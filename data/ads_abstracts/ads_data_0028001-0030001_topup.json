In the standard method, galaxy line-of-sight velocities, v, or velocity dispersions are used to infer cluster masses, M, to quantify the halo mass function (HMF), {dn}(M)/d{log}(M), which is strongly affected by mass measurement errors. In our new method, the probability distributions of velocities for each cluster in the sample are summed to create a new statistic called the velocity distribution function (VDF), {dn}(v)/{dv}. The VDF can be measured more directly and precisely than the HMF and can be robustly predicted with cosmological simulations that capture the dynamics of subhalos or galaxies. We apply these two methods to realistic (ideal) mock cluster catalogs with (without) interlopers and forecast the bias and constraints on the matter density parameter Ω<SUB>m</SUB> and the amplitude of matter fluctuations σ<SUB>8</SUB> in flat ΛCDM cosmologies. For an example observation of 200 massive clusters, the VDF with (without) interloping galaxies constrains the parameter combination {σ }<SUB>8</SUB> {{{Ω }}}<SUB>m</SUB><SUP>0.29(0.29)</SUP>=0.589+/- 0.014 (0.584+/- 0.011) and shows only minor bias. However, the HMF with interlopers is biased to low Ω<SUB>m</SUB> and high σ<SUB>8</SUB> and the fiducial model lies well outside of the forecast constraints, prior to accounting for Eddington bias. When the VDF is combined with constraints from the cosmic microwave background, the degeneracy between cosmological parameters can be significantly reduced. Upcoming spectroscopic surveys that probe larger volumes and fainter magnitudes will provide clusters for applying the VDF as a cosmological probe.","read_count":43,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922609","page":["106"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835..106N","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Ntampaka, M.","Trac, H.","Cisewski, J.","Price, L.

Most known hot DOGs are located at z> 1.5, due in part to a strong bias against identifying them at lower redshift related to the selection criteria. We present a new selection method that identifies 153 hot DOG candidates at z̃ 1, where they are significantly brighter and easier to study. We validate this approach by measuring a redshift z = 1.009 and finding a spectral energy distribution similar to that of higher-redshift hot DOGs for one of these objects, WISE J1036+0449 ({L}<SUB>{Bol</SUB>}≃ 8× {10}<SUP>46</SUP> {erg} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>).

We also find that other hot DOGs observed by X-ray facilities show a similar deficiency of X-ray flux. We discuss the origin of the X-ray weakness and the absorption properties of hot DOGs. Hot DOGs at z≲ 1 could be excellent laboratories to probe the characteristics of the accretion flow and of the X-ray emitting plasma at extreme values of the Eddington ratio.","citation_count":10,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922560","page":["105"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835..105R","bibgroup":["Keck","CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Ricci, C.","Assef, R.

Here, we assess these results by measuring the stellar kinematics on a sample of 315 galaxies, without a morphological selection, using two-dimensional integral field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. Proxies for the spin parameter ({λ }<SUB>{R</SUB><SUB>{{e</SUB>}}}) and ellipticity ({∊ }<SUB>{{e</SUB>}}) are used to separate fast and slow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regular rotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies. We confirm that regular rotators show a strong h<SUB>3</SUB> versus V/σ anti-correlation, whereas quasi-regular and non-regular rotators show a more vertical relation in h<SUB>3</SUB> and V/σ . Motivated by recent cosmological simulations, we develop an alternative approach to kinematically classify galaxies from their individual h<SUB>3</SUB> versus V/σ signatures. Within the SAMI Galaxy Survey, we identify five classes of high-order stellar kinematic signatures using Gaussian mixture models. Class 1 corresponds to slow rotators, whereas Classes 2-5 correspond to fast rotators. We find that galaxies with similar {λ }<SUB>{R</SUB><SUB>{{e</SUB>}}}{--}{∊ }<SUB>{{e</SUB>}} values can show distinctly different {h}<SUB>3</SUB>{--}V/σ signatures. Class 5 objects are previously unidentified fast rotators that show a weak h<SUB>3</SUB> versus V/σ anti-correlation. From simulations, these objects are predicted to be disk-less galaxies formed by gas-poor mergers. From morphological examination, however, there is evidence for large stellar disks. Instead, Class 5 objects are more likely disturbed galaxies, have counter-rotating bulges, or bars in edge-on galaxies. Finally, we interpret the strong anti-correlation in h<SUB>3</SUB> versus V/σ as evidence for disks in most fast rotators, suggesting a dearth of gas-poor mergers among fast rotators.","citation_count":14,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922579","page":["104"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835..104V","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["van de Sande, Jesse","Bland-Hawthorn, Joss","Fogarty, Lisa M.

The GW signals can arrive earlier than the EM signals in some cases if the GW/EM signals have passed through a lens, even if both signals were emitted simultaneously by a source. GW wavelengths are much larger than EM wavelengths; therefore, the propagation of the GWs does not follow the laws of geometrical optics, including the Shapiro time delay, if the lens mass is less than approximately 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>(f/Hz)<SUP>-1</SUP>, where f is the GW frequency.

For example, when a distant supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in a galactic center is lensed by an intervening galaxy, the time lag becomes of the order of 10 days. Future pulsar timing arrays including the Square Kilometre Array and X-ray detectors may detect several time lags by measuring the orbital phase differences between the GW/EM signals in the SMBHBs. Gravitational lensing imprints a characteristic modulation on a chirp waveform; therefore, we can deduce whether a measured arrival time lag arises from intrinsic source properties or gravitational lensing. Determination of arrival time differences would be extremely useful in multimessenger observations and tests of general relativity.","read_count":157,"citation_count":9,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922511","page":["103"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835..103T","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Takahashi, Ryuichi"],"aff":["Faculty of Science and Technology, Hirosaki University, 3 Bunkyo-cho, Hirosaki, Aomori 036-8561, Japan"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/103"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:2"],"keyword":["gravitational lensing: strong","gravitational waves","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nI would like to thank the members of the astrophysics group at Hirosaki University for their useful comments and discussions.

The scattering matrix elements are the most commonly used measured quantities to describe scattering problems. We use the wavefunctions of scattered waves of NOAAs 11084 and 11092 measured in the previous study to compute the scattering matrix elements, with plane waves as the basis. The measured scattered wavefunction is from the incident wave of radial order n to the wave of another radial order n′, for n=0{--}5. For a time-independent sunspot, there is no mode mixing between different frequencies. An incident mode is scattered into various modes with different wavenumbers but the same frequency. Working in the frequency domain, we have the individual incident plane-wave mode, which is scattered into various plane-wave modes with the same frequency. This allows us to compute the scattering matrix element between two plane-wave modes for each frequency. Each scattering matrix element is a complex number, representing the transition from the incident mode to another mode.

All four of these galaxies have huge cluster populations (to the radial limits of our data, comprising from 12,000 to 23,000 clusters per galaxy). The metallicity distribution functions (MDFs) of the GCs can still be matched by a bimodal-Gaussian form where the metal-rich and metal-poor modes are separated by ≃ 0.8 dex, but the internal dispersions of each mode are so large that the total MDF becomes very broad and nearly continuous from [Fe/H] ≃ -2.4 to solar. There are, however, significant differences between galaxies in the relative numbers of metal-rich clusters, suggesting that they underwent significantly different histories of mergers with massive gas-rich halos. Last, the proportion of metal-poor GCs rises especially rapidly outside projected radii R≳ 4 {R}<SUB>{eff</SUB>}, suggesting the importance of accreted dwarf satellites in the outer halo.

The excellent time coverage of our spectropolarimetry has allowed better monitoring of the evolution of polarization features than is typical, which has allowed us new insight into the nature of normal SNe Ia. SN 2011fe exhibits time-dependent polarization in both the continuum and strong absorption lines. At early epochs, red wavelengths exhibit a degree of continuum polarization of up to 0.4%, likely indicative of a mild asymmetry in the electron-scattering photosphere. This behavior is more common in subluminous SNe Ia than in normal events, such as SN 2011fe. The degree of polarization across a collection of absorption lines varies dramatically from epoch to epoch. During the earliest epoch, a λ4600-5000 Å complex of absorption lines shows enhanced polarization at a different position angle than the continuum. We explore the origin of these features, presenting a few possible interpretations, without arriving at a single favored ion. During two epochs near maximum, the dominant polarization feature is associated with the Si II λ6355 Å absorption line. This is common for SNe Ia, but for SN 2011fe the polarization of this feature increases after maximum light, whereas for other SNe Ia, that polarization feature was strongest before maximum light.","read_count":22,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922525","page":["100"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835..100M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Milne, Peter A.","Williams, G.

We study the sensitivity of limb darkening to changes in area filling factor using a 3D MHD model of the magnetized photosphere. The limb darkening change expected from the measured 11-year area variation lies below the level of measured limb darkening variations, for a reasonable range of magnetic flux in quiet network and internetwork regions. So the remarkably constant limb darkening observed over the solar activity cycle is not inconsistent with the measured 11-year change in area of quiet magnetic network.

We find that 20 (42 ± 9%) of the spectroscopically identified z> 0.8 sources have consistent star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from both submillimeter and radio observations, while the remaining sources have lower (mostly undetected) submillimeter fluxes, suggesting that active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity dominates the radio power in these sources. We develop a classification scheme based on the ratio of submillimeter flux to radio power versus radio power and find that it agrees with AGN and star-forming galaxy classifications from Very Long Baseline Interferometry. Our results provide support for an extremely rapid drop in the number of high SFR galaxies above about a thousand solar masses per year (Kroupa initial mass function) and for the locally determined relation between X-ray luminosity and radio power for star-forming galaxies applying at high redshifts and high radio powers. We measure far-infrared (FIR) luminosities and find that some AGNs lie on the FIR-radio correlation, while others scatter below. The AGNs that lie on the correlation appear to do so based on their emission from the AGN torus. We measure a median radio size of 1.″0 ± 0.3 for the star-forming galaxies. The radio sizes of the star-forming galaxies are generally larger than those of the AGNs. The W. M.

In this paper, we apply a new method based on the filament drainage to 571 erupting filaments from 2010 May to 2015 December in order to determine the filament chirality and its hemispheric preference. It is found that 91.6% of our sample of erupting filaments follows the hemispheric rule of helicity sign. It is also found that the strength of the hemispheric preference of the quiescent filaments decreases slightly from ̃97% in the rising phase to ̃85% in the declining phase of solar cycle 24, whereas the strength of the intermediate filaments keeps a high value around 96 ± 4% at all times. Only the active-region filaments show significant variations. Their strength of the hemispheric rule rises from ̃63% to ̃95% in the rising phase, and keeps a high value of 82% ± 5% during the declining phase. Furthermore, during a half-year period around the solar maximum, their hemispheric preference totally vanishes. Additionally, we also diagnose the magnetic configurations of the filaments based on our indirect method and find that in our sample of erupting events, 89% are inverse-polarity filaments with a flux rope magnetic configuration, whereas 11% are normal-polarity filaments with a sheared arcade configuration.","citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922538","page":["94"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...94O","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Ouyang, Y.","Zhou, Y.

The state of the art method resolves spatial structures within a galaxy to assess the total stellar mass content. In comparison to unresolved studies, resolved methods yield, on average, higher fractions of stellar mass for galaxies. In this work we improve the current method in order to mitigate a bias related to the resolved spatial distribution derived for the mass. The bias consists in an apparent filamentary mass distribution and a spatial coincidence between mass structures and dust lanes near spiral arms. The improved method is based on iterative Bayesian marginalization, through a new algorithm we have named Bayesian Successive Priors (BSP). We have applied BSP to M51 and to a pilot sample of 90 spiral galaxies from the Ohio State University Bright Spiral Galaxy Survey. By quantitatively comparing both methods, we find that the average fraction of stellar mass missed by unresolved studies is only half what previously thought. In contrast with the previous method, the output BSP mass maps bear a better resemblance to near-infrared images.","read_count":28,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922506","page":["93"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...93M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Martínez-García, Eric E.","González-Lópezlira, Rosa A.","Magris C., Gladis","Bruzual A., Gustavo"],"aff":["Cerrada del Rey 40-A, Chimalcoyoc Tlalpan, Ciudad de México, C.P. 14630, México","Instituto de Radioastronomía y Astrofísica, UNAM, Campus Morelia, Michoacán, C.P. 58089, México ; Argelander Institut für Astronomie, Universität Bonn, Auf dem Hügel 71, D-53121 Bonn, Germany","Centro de Investigaciones de Astronomía, Apartado Postal 264, Mérida 5101-A, Venezuela","Instituto de Radioastronomía y Astrofísica, UNAM, Campus Morelia, Michoacán, C.P. 58089, México"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/93"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["NED:1","SIMBAD:92"],"keyword":["galaxies: fundamental parameters","galaxies: photometry","galaxies: spiral","galaxies: stellar content","methods: statistical","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe acknowledge the referee’s comments and suggestions that significantly improved the quality of the manuscript.

Setting a prior on the cosmic curvature parameter -0.007 < Ω<SUB>k</SUB> < 0.006, we obtained the constraint on the PPN parameter that γ ={1.000}<SUB>-0.0025</SUB><SUP>+0.0023</SUP>. We conclude that strong lensing systems with measured stellar velocity dispersions may serve as another important probe to investigate validity of the GR, if the mass-dynamical structure of the lensing galaxies is accurately constrained in future lens surveys.","read_count":51,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922590","page":["92"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...92C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Cao, Shuo","Li, Xiaolei","Biesiada, Marek","Xu, Tengpeng","Cai, Yongzhi","Zhu, Zong-Hong"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, Beijing Normal University, 100875, Beijing, China","Department of Astronomy, Beijing Normal University, 100875, Beijing, China","Department of Astronomy, Beijing Normal University, 100875, Beijing, China; Department of Astrophysics and Cosmology, Institute of Physics, University of Silesia, Uniwersytecka 4, 40-007 Katowice, Poland","Department of Astronomy, Beijing Normal University, 100875, Beijing, China","Department of Astronomy, Beijing Normal University, 100875, Beijing, China","Department of Astronomy, Beijing Normal University, 100875, Beijing, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","0000-0003-1308-7304","-","-","0000-0002-3567-6743"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/92"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["galaxies: structure","gravitational lensing: strong","cosmology: observations","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis work was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology National Basic Science Program (Project 973) under grant Nos. 2012CB821804 and 2014CB845806, the Strategic Priority Research Program “The Emergence of Cosmological Structure” of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (No. XDB09000000), the National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant Nos. 11503001, 11373014, and 11073005, the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities and Scientific Research Foundation of Beijing Normal University, China Postdoctoral Science Foundation under grant No. 2015T80052, and the Opening Project of Key Laboratory of Computational Astrophysics, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Our analysis is based on high-resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio H-band spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) and optical spectra from several instruments. The absolute differences between the Mg abundances derived from the two wavelength bands are always less than 0.1 dex in the NLTE analysis, while they are slightly larger for the LTE case. This suggests that our Mg atomic model is appropriate for investigating the NLTE formation of the H-band Mg lines. The NLTE corrections for the Mg I H-band lines are sensitive to the surface gravity, becoming larger for smaller log g values, and strong lines are more susceptible to departures from LTE. For cool giants, NLTE corrections tend to be negative, and for the strong line at 15765 Å they reach -0.14 dex in our sample, and up to -0.22 dex for other APOGEE stars. Our results suggest that it is important to include NLTE corrections in determining Mg abundances from the H-band Mg I transitions, especially when strong lines are used.

We outline here a more fundamental approach based on flux tubes of canonical vorticity, where canonical vorticity is defined as the circulation of the species’ canonical momentum. This approach extends the concept of magnetic flux tube evolution to include the effects of finite particle momentum and enables visualization of the topology of plasma jets in regimes beyond MHD. A flared, current-carrying magnetic flux tube in an ion-electron plasma with finite ion momentum is thus equivalent to either a pair of electron and ion flow flux tubes, a pair of electron and ion canonical momentum flux tubes, or a pair of electron and ion canonical vorticity flux tubes. We examine the morphology of all these flux tubes for increasing electrical currents, different radial current profiles, different electron Mach numbers, and a fixed, flared, axisymmetric magnetic geometry. Calculations of gauge-invariant relative canonical helicities track the evolution of magnetic, cross, and kinetic helicities in the system, and show that ion flow fields can unwind to compensate for an increasing magnetic twist. The results demonstrate that including a species’ finite momentum can result in a very long collimated canonical vorticity flux tube even if the magnetic flux tube is flared. With finite momentum, particle density gradients must be normal to canonical vorticities, not to magnetic fields, so observations of collimated astrophysical jets could be images of canonical vorticity flux tubes instead of magnetic flux tubes.","read_count":17,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922548","page":["89"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...89S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Sander Lavine, Eric","You, Setthivoine"],"aff":["University of Washington, 4000 15th Street, NE Aeronautics and Astronautics 211 Guggenheim Hall, Box 352400, Seattle, WA 98195, USA","University of Washington, 4000 15th Street, NE Aeronautics and Astronautics 211 Guggenheim Hall, Box 352400, Seattle, WA 98195, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-0354-9088","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/89"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:1"],"keyword":["galaxies: jets","ISM: jets and outflows","plasmas","stars: winds","outflows","Sun: filaments","prominences","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics - Plasma Physics"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"\nThis work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy Grant No. DE-SC0010340.

We include a spread in abundance values for carbon and magnesium based on observations of their variability in nearby stars; we choose an arbitrary spread in neon abundance values commensurate with the range seen in other low Z elements due to the difficult nature of obtaining precise measurements of neon abundances in stars. As indicated by the results of Truitt et al., it is essential that we understand how differences in individual elemental abundances, and not just the total scaled metallicity, can measurably impact a star’s evolutionary lifetime and other physical characteristics. In that work, we found that oxygen abundances significantly impacted the stellar evolution; carbon, magnesium, and neon are potentially important elements to individually consider due to their relatively high (but also variable) abundances in stars. We present 528 new stellar main-sequence models, and we calculate the time-dependent evolution of the associated habitable zone boundaries for each based on mass, temperature, and luminosity. We also reintroduce the 2 Gyr “Continuously Habitable Zone” (CHZ<SUB>2</SUB>) as a useful tool to help gauge the habitability potential for a given planetary system.","read_count":19,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922557","page":["87"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...87T","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Truitt, Amanda","Young, Patrick A."],"aff":["School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA","School of Earth and Space Exploration, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85287, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-1449-3008","0000-0003-1705-5991"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/87"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["astrobiology","astronomical databases: miscellaneous","catalogs","planetary systems","stars: abundances","stars: evolution","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe results reported herein benefitted from collaborations and/or information exchange within NASA’s Nexus for Exoplanet System Science (NExSS) research coordination network sponsored by NASA’s Science Mission Directorate.\n","doctype":"article","title":["Expanding the Catalog: Considering the Importance of Carbon, Magnesium, and Neon in the Evolution of Stars and Habitable Zones"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-09T00:00:52.048Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv160607316C"],"identifier":["2016arXiv160607316C","2017ApJ...835...86C","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/86","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/86","1606.07316","2016arXiv160607316C"],"first_author":"Chen, Yun","abstract":"We use 28 measurements of the Hubble parameter, H(z), at intermediate redshifts 0.07≤slant z≤slant 2.3 to determine the present-day Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> in four cosmological models.

Loops are puzzling because they show little evidence of tangling or braiding, at least on the quiet Sun, despite the chaotic nature of the solar surface convection. Prominences are mysterious because the origin of their underlying magnetic structure—filament channels—is poorly understood at best. These two types of features would seem to be quite unrelated and wholly distinct. We argue that, on the contrary, they are inextricably linked and result from a single process: the injection of magnetic helicity into the corona by photospheric motions and the subsequent evolution of this helicity by coronal reconnection. In this paper, we present numerical simulations of the response of a Parker (1972) corona to photospheric driving motions that have varying degrees of helicity preference. We obtain four main conclusions: (1) in agreement with the helicity condensation model of Antiochos (2013), the inverse cascade of helicity by magnetic reconnection in the corona results in the formation of filament channels localized about polarity inversion lines; (2) this same process removes most complex fine structure from the rest of the corona, resulting in smooth and laminar coronal loops; (3) the amount of remnant tangling in coronal loops is inversely dependent on the net helicity injected by the driving motions; and (4) the structure of the solar corona depends only on the helicity preference of the driving motions and not on their detailed time dependence. We discuss the implications of our results for high-resolution observations of the corona.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922571","page":["85"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...85K","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Knizhnik, K.

For instance, the hemisphere in which sunspot activity is more active tends to switch after the early half of each solar cycle. Svalgaard & Kamide recently pointed out that the time gaps of polar field reversal between the northern and southern hemispheres are simply consequences of the asymmetry of sunspot activity. However, the mechanism underlying the asymmetric feature in solar cycle activity is not yet well understood. In this paper, in order to explain the cause of the asymmetry from the theoretical point of view, we investigate the relationship between the dipole- and quadrupole-type components of the magnetic field in the solar cycle using the mean-field theory based on the flux transport dynamo model. As a result, we found that there are two different attractors of the solar cycle, in which either the north or the south polar field is first reversed, and that the flux transport dynamo model explains well the phase-asymmetry of sunspot activity and the polar field reversal without any ad hoc source of asymmetry.","read_count":18,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922522","page":["84"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...84S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Shukuya, D.","Kusano, K."],"aff":["Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan","Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, Nagoya University, Furo-cho, Chikusa-ku, Nagoya, Aichi 4648601, Japan"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-7518-0032","0000-0002-6814-6810"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/84"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["dynamo","methods: numerical","Sun: evolution","Sun: interior","Sun: magnetic fields","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nOur simulation code was devised based on the solar dynamo code SURYA developed by professor A.

Its first campaign covered a field near the north Galactic cap, a region never covered before by large asteroseismic-ensemble investigations, and was therefore of particular interest for exploring this part of our Galaxy. Here we report the asteroseismic analysis of all stars selected by the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program during the mission's “north Galactic cap” campaign 1. Our consolidated analysis uses six independent methods to measure the global seismic properties, in particular the large frequency separation and the frequency of maximum power. From the full target sample of 8630 stars we find about 1200 oscillating red giants, a number comparable with estimates from galactic synthesis modeling. Thus, as a valuable by-product we find roughly 7500 stars to be dwarfs, which provide a sample well suited for galactic exoplanet occurrence studies because they originate from our simple and easily reproducible selection function. In addition, to facilitate the full potential of the data set for galactic archaeology, we assess the detection completeness of our sample of oscillating red giants.

The original Frebel et al. analysis of these stars was able to derive estimates of [Fe/H] and [C/Fe] only for a subset of the sample, due to limitations in the methodology then available. A new spectroscopic analysis pipeline has been used to obtain estimates of {T}<SUB>{eff</SUB>}, {log} g, [Fe/H], and [C/Fe] for almost the entire data set. This sample is very local—about 90% of the stars are located within 0.5 kpc of the Sun. We consider the chemodynamical properties of these stars in concert with a similarly local sample of stars from a recent analysis of the Bidelman and MacConnell “weak metal” candidates by Beers et al. We use this combined sample to identify possible members of the halo stream of stars suggested by Helmi et al. and Chiba & Beers, as well as stars that may be associated with stripped debris from the putative parent dwarf of the globular cluster Omega Centauri, suggested to exist by previous authors. We identify a clear increase in the cumulative frequency of carbon-enhanced metal-poor (CEMP) stars with declining metallicity, as well as an increase in the fraction of CEMP stars with distance from the Galactic plane, consistent with previous results. We also identify a relatively large number of CEMP stars with kinematics consistent with the metal-weak thick-disk population, with possible implications for its origin.","read_count":35,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922552","page":["81"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...81B","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Beers, Timothy C.","Placco, Vinicius M.","Carollo, Daniela","Rossi, Silvia","Lee, Young Sun","Frebel, Anna","Norris, John E.","Dietz, Sarah","Masseron, Thomas"],"aff":["Department of Physics and JINA Center for the Evolution of the Elements, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA","Department of Physics and JINA Center for the Evolution of the Elements, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA","Department of Physics and JINA Center for the Evolution of the Elements, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA","Instituto de Astronomia, Geofísica e Ciências Atmosféricas, Departamento de Astronomia, Universidade de São Paulo, Rua do Matão 1226, 05508-900 São Paulo, Brazil","Department of Astronomy & Space Science, Chungnam National University, Daejeon 34134, Korea","Massachussetts Institute of Technology and Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, MA, 02139, USA","Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, The Australian National University, Mount Stromlo Observatory, Cotter Road, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia","Department of Physics and JINA Center for the Evolution of the Elements, University of Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN 46556, USA","Institute of Astronomy, University of Cambridge, Madingley Road, CB3 0HA, Cambridge, UK"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0003-4479-1265","0000-0003-4710-132X","-","0000-0001-5297-4518","0000-0002-2139-7145","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/81"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["CDS:1","SIMBAD:123"],"keyword":["Galaxy: kinematics and dynamics","Galaxy: stellar content","stars: abundances","stars: carbon","stars: Population II","stars: kinematics and dynamics","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nT.C.B., D.C., V.M.P., and S.D. acknowledge partial support for this work from grants PHY 08-22648, Physics Frontier Center/JINA, and PHY 14-30152, Physics Frontier Center/JINA Center for the Evolution of the Elements, awarded by the US National Science Foundation.

We find, in agreement with previous studies, that the bar fraction increases with increasing stellar mass. A similar trend is found with total baryonic mass, although the dependence is not as strong as with stellar mass, due to the contribution of gas. The bar fraction shows a decrease with increasing gas mass fraction. This anticorrelation between the likelihood of a galaxy hosting a bar with the gas richness of the galaxy results from the inhibiting effect the gas has in the formation of bars. We also find that for massive galaxies with stellar masses larger than 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, at fixed stellar mass, the bar fraction decreases with increasing global halo mass (I.e., halo mass measured up to a radius of the order of the H I disk extent).","read_count":30,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922602","page":["80"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...80C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Cervantes Sodi, Bernardo"],"aff":["Instituto de Radioastronomía y Astrofísica, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Campus Morelia, A.P. 3-72, C.P. 58089 Michoacán, México"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/80"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["galaxies: fundamental parameters","galaxies: halos","galaxies: spiral","galaxies: statistics","galaxies: structure","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe author thanks Changbom Park for providing the sample for the present study, and S.

Compared to previous releases, the main novelties and improvements are use of new TP-AGB tracks and related atmosphere models and spectra for M and C-type stars; inclusion of the surface H+He+CNO abundances in the isochrone tables, accounting for the effects of diffusion, dredge-up episodes and hot-bottom burning; inclusion of complete thermal pulse cycles, with a complete description of the in-cycle changes in the stellar parameters; new pulsation models to describe the long-period variability in the fundamental and first-overtone modes; and new dust models that follow the growth of the grains during the AGB evolution, in combination with radiative transfer calculations for the reprocessing of the photospheric emission. Overall, these improvements are expected to lead to a more consistent and detailed description of properties of TP-AGB stars expected in resolved stellar populations, especially in regard to their mean photometric properties from optical to mid-infrared wavelengths. We illustrate the expected numbers of TP-AGB stars of different types in stellar populations covering a wide range of ages and initial metallicities, providing further details on the “C-star island” that appears at intermediate values of age and metallicity, and about the AGB-boosting effect that occurs at ages close to 1.6-Gyr for populations of all metallicities.

There is ̃0.75 dex of scatter in this relationship from clouds like Sgr B2, which has an integrated HCN 1-0 intensity of a cloud less than half its mass, and others that have HCN 1-0 enhanced by a factor of 2-3 relative to clouds of comparable mass. We identify the two primary sources of scatter to be self-absorption and variations in HCN abundance. We also find that the extended HCN 1-0 emission is more intense per unit mass than in individual cloud cores. In fact the majority (80%) of HCN 1-0 emission comes from extended gas with column densities below 7 × 10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, accounting for 68% of the total mass. We find variations in the brightness of HCN 1-0 would only yield a ̃10% error in the dense gas mass inferred from this line in the Galactic center. However, the observed order of magnitude HCN abundance variations, and the systematic nature of these variations, warn of potential biases in the use of HCN as dense gas mass tracer in more extreme environments such as an active galactic nucleus and shock-dominated regions. We also investigate other 3 mm tracers, finding that HNCO is better correlated with mass than HCN, and might be a better tracer of cloud mass in this environment.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922535","page":["76"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...76M","bibgroup":["Spitzer","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mills, Elisabeth A.

A comparison of their rotation periods is a test of the gyrochronology concept. To find their periods I calculated the autocorrelation function (ACF) of the Kepler mission photometry for each star. In most systems for which good periods can be found, the cooler star has a longer period than the hotter component, in general agreement with models. However, there is a wide range in the gradients of lines connecting binary pairs in a period-color diagram. Furthermore, near the solar color, only a few stars have longer periods than the Sun, suggesting that they, and their cooler companions, are not much older than the Sun. In addition, there is an apparent gap at intermediate periods in the period distribution of the late K and early M stars. Either star formation in this direction has been variable, or stars evolve in period at a non-uniform rate, or some stars evolve more rapidly than others at the same mass. Finally, using the ACF as a measure of the activity level, I found that while the F, G, and early K stars become less active as their periods increase, there is no correlation between period and activity for the mid K to early M stars.","read_count":42,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922604","page":["75"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...75J","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Janes, K.

Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) at supernova remnant (SNR) shock fronts is thought to accelerate galactic CRs to energies below the knee, while an extragalactic origin is presumed for CRs with energies beyond the ankle. CRs with energies between 3 × 10<SUP>15</SUP> and 10<SUP>18</SUP> eV, which we dub the “shin,” have an unknown origin. It has been proposed that DSA at galactic wind termination shocks, rather than at SNR shocks, may accelerate CRs to these energies. This paper uses the galactic wind model of Bustard et al. to analyze whether galactic wind termination shocks may accelerate CRs to shin energies within a reasonable acceleration time and whether such CRs can subsequently diffuse back to the Galaxy. We argue for acceleration times on the order of 100 Myr rather than a few billion years, as assumed in some previous works, and we discuss prospects for magnetic field amplification at the shock front. Ultimately, we generously assume that the magnetic field is amplified to equipartition. This formalism allows us to obtain analytic formulae, applicable to any wind model, for CR acceleration. Even with generous assumptions, we find that very high wind velocities are required to set up the necessary conditions for acceleration beyond 10<SUP>17</SUP> eV. We also estimate the luminosities of CRs accelerated by outflow termination shocks, including estimates for the Milky Way wind.","read_count":39,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922591","page":["72"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...72B","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Bustard, Chad","Zweibel, Ellen G.","Cotter, Cory"],"aff":["Physics Department, University of Wisconsin─Madison, 1150 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706, USA","Physics Department, University of Wisconsin─Madison, 1150 University Avenue, Madison, WI 53706, USA; Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin─Madison, 2535 Sterling Hall, 475 N.

Using particle instruments on the Advanced Composition Explorer, Solar and Heliospheric Observatory and Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory spacecraft, we analyzed heavy ion data from 4 SEP events taking place between 2006 December and 2014 December. We constructed 36 different ionic pairs and studied their time evolution in each event. We quantified the temporal behavior of abundant SEP ratios by fitting the data to derive a decay time constant B. We also considered the ratio of ionic mass-to-charge for each pair, the S value given, e.g., for Fe/O by {S}<SUB>{Fe</SUB>/{{O}}}={(M/Q)}<SUB>{Fe</SUB>}/{(M/Q)}<SUB>{{O</SUB>}}. We found that the temporal behavior of SEP ratios is ordered by the value of S: ratios with S> 1 showed decreases over time (I.e., B< 0) and those with S< 1 showed increases (B> 0). We plotted B as a function of S and observed a clear monotonic dependence: ratios with a large S decayed at a higher rate. A prominent discontinuity at S = 2.0 (corresponding to He/H) was found in three of the four events, suggesting anomalous behavior of protons. The X/H ratios often show an initial increase followed by a decrease, and decay at a slower rate. We discuss possible causes of the observed B versus S trends within current understanding of SEP propagation.","read_count":12,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922578","page":["71"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...71Z","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zelina, P.","Dalla, S.","Cohen, C.

Based on two samples of normal star-forming galaxies selected by the BPT diagram, we explore the correlations between u-band, Hα, and IR luminosities by combing SCUSS data with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). The attenuation-corrected u-band luminosities are tightly correlated with the Balmer decrement-corrected Hα luminosities with an rms scatter of ̃0.17 dex. The IR-corrected u luminosities are derived based on the correlations between the attenuation of u-band luminosities and WISE 12 (or 22) μm luminosities, and then calibrated with the Balmer-corrected Hα luminosities. The systematic residuals of these calibrations are tested against the physical properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. We find that the best-fitting nonlinear relations are better than the linear ones and recommended to be applied in the measurement of SFRs. The systematic deviations mainly come from the pollution of old stellar population and the effect of dust extinction; therefore, a more detailed analysis is needed in future work.","read_count":24,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922512","page":["70"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...70Z","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zhou, Zhimin","Zhou, Xu","Wu, Hong","Fan, Xiao-Hui","Fan, Zhou","Jiang, Zhao-Ji","Jing, Yi-Peng","Li, Cheng","Lesser, Michael","Jiang, Lin-Hua","Ma, Jun","Nie, Jun-Dan","Shen, Shi-Yin","Wang, Jia-Li","Wu, Zhen-Yu","Zhang, Tian-Meng","Zou, Hu"],"aff":["Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100012, China","Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100012, China","Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100012, China","Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA","Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100012, China","Key Laboratory of Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100012, China","Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Department of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China","Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Science, 80 Nandan Road, Shanghai 200030, P.

Based on this analysis, we attempt to answer two questions: Is a three-parameter log-normal distribution a good candidate to satisfy the void size distributions obtained from different types of environments? Is there a direct relation between the shape parameters of the void size distribution and the environmental effects? In an attempt to answer these questions, we find here that all void size distributions of these data samples satisfy the three-parameter log-normal distribution whether the environment is dominated by DM, haloes, or galaxies. In addition, the shape parameters of the three-parameter log-normal void size distribution seem highly affected by environment, particularly existing substructures. Therefore, we show two quantitative relations given by linear equations between the skewness and the maximum tree depth, and between the variance of the void size distribution and the maximum tree depth, directly from the simulated data. In addition to this, we find that the percentage of voids with nonzero central density in the data sets has a critical importance. If the number of voids with nonzero central density reaches ≥3.84% in a simulation/mock sample, then a second population is observed in the void size distributions. This second population emerges as a second peak in the log-normal void size distribution at larger radius.","read_count":16,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922585","page":["69"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...69R","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Russell, E.","Pycke, J. -R."],"aff":["Division of Science and Mathematics, New York University Abu Dhabi, P.O.

This discrepancy suggests the diverse origins of JFCs and clouds the issue of the origin of Earth’s oceanic water. Here we demonstrate that Eley-Rideal reactions between accelerated water ions and deuterated cometary surface analogs can lead to instantaneous deuterium enrichment in water scattered from the surface. The reaction proceeds with H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUP>+</SUP> abstracting adsorbed D atoms, forming an excited H<SUB>2</SUB>DO* state, which dissociates subsequently to produce energetic HDO. Hydronium ions are also produced readily by the abstraction of H atoms, consistent with H<SUB>3</SUB>O<SUP>+</SUP> detection and abundance in various comets. Experiments with water isotopologs and kinematic analysis on deuterated platinum surfaces confirmed the dynamic abstraction mechanism. The instantaneous fractionation process is independent of the surface temperature and may operate on the surface of cometary nuclei or dust grains, composed of deuterium-rich silicates and carbonaceous chondrites. The requisite energetic water ions have been detected in the coma of 67P in two populations. This dynamic fractionation process may temporarily increase the water D/H ratio, especially as the comet gets closer to the Sun. The magnitude of the effect depends on the water ion energy-flux and the deuterium content of the exposed cometary surfaces.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922527","page":["67"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...67Y","identifier":["2017ApJ...835...67Y","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/67","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/67"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Yao, Yunxi","Giapis, Konstantinos P."],"aff":["Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA","Division of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, California 91125, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/67"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["astrochemistry","comets: general","methods: laboratory: molecular","molecular processes"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis report was based on work funded by the NSF (Award No. 1202567).\n","doctype":"article","title":["Dynamic Deuterium Enrichment in Cometary Water via Eley-Rideal Reactions"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-03T18:17:06.562Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161103496P"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161103496P","2017ApJ...835...66P","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/66","2016arXiv161103496P","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/66","1611.03496"],"first_author":"Posselt, B.","abstract":"We report on six new Chandra observations of the Geminga pulsar wind nebula (PWN). The PWN consists of three distinct elongated structures—two ≈ 0.2{d}<SUB>250</SUB> pc long lateral tails and a segmented axial tail of ≈ 0.05{d}<SUB>250</SUB> pc length, where {d}<SUB>250</SUB>=d/(250 {pc}). The photon indices of the power-law spectra of the lateral tails, {{Γ }}≈ 1, are significantly harder than those of the pulsar ({{Γ }}≈ 1.5) and the axial tail ({{Γ }}≈ 1.6). There is no significant diffuse X-ray emission between the lateral tails—the ratio of the X-ray surface brightness between the south tail and this sky area is at least 12. The lateral tails apparently connect directly to the pulsar and show indications of moving footpoints. The axial tail comprises time-variable emission blobs. However, there is no evidence for constant or decelerated outward motion of these blobs. Different physical models are consistent with the observed morphology and spectra of the Geminga PWN. In one scenario, the lateral tails could represent an azimuthally asymmetric shell whose hard emission is caused by the Fermi acceleration mechanism of colliding winds. In another scenario, the lateral tails could be luminous, bent polar outflows, while the blobs in the axial tail could represent a crushed torus. In a resemblance to planetary magnetotails, the blobs of the axial tail might also represent short-lived plasmoids, which are formed by magnetic field reconnection in the relativistic plasma of the pulsar wind tail.","citation_count":9,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922564","page":["66"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...66P","bibgroup":["CXC","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Posselt, B.","Pavlov, G.

In addition to the primary catalog table containing supernova metadata, an individual page is generated for each supernova, which displays its available metadata, light curves, and spectra spanning X-ray to radio frequencies. The data presented in the catalog is automatically rebuilt on a daily basis and is constructed by parsing several dozen sources, including the data presented in the supernova literature and from secondary sources such as other web-based catalogs. Individual supernova data is stored in the hierarchical, human- and machine-readable JSON format, with the entirety of each supernova’s data being contained within a single JSON file bearing its name. The setup we present here, which is based on open-source software maintained via git repositories hosted on github, enables anyone to download the entirety of the supernova data set to their home computer in minutes, and to make contributions of their own data back to the catalog via git. As the supernova data set continues to grow, especially in the upcoming era of all-sky synoptic telescopes, which will increase the total number of events by orders of magnitude, we hope that the catalog we have designed will be a valuable tool for the community to analyze both historical and contemporary supernovae.","citation_count":49,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922540","page":["64"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...64G","bibgroup":["CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Guillochon, James","Parrent, Jerod","Kelley, Luke Zoltan","Margutti, Raffaella"],"aff":["Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) and Department of Physics and Astrophysics, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208, USA; New York University, Physics Department, 4 Washington Place, New York, NY 10003, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-9809-8215","0000-0002-5103-7706","-","0000-0003-4768-7586"],"issue":"1","orcid_other":["-","-","0000-0002-6625-6450","-"],"volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/64"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["NED:1","SIMBAD:91"],"keyword":["catalogs","ISM: supernova remnants","supernovae: general","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank Brad Cenko, Maria Drout, Or Graur, Atish Kamble, Bob Kirschner, Dan Milisavljevic, Gautham Narayan, Matt Nicholl, Ashley Pagnotta, Ed Shaya, Isaac Shivvers, Jeff Silverman, Alicia Soderberg, and Łukasz Wyrzykowski for constructive suggestions and comments.

We calculate their mutual polarity match and the power of the radial decay, p, of the radial field using different source surface distances and different number of harmonic multipoles. We find the average polarity match of 82% for the declining phase, 78%-79% for maxima, 76%-78% for the ascending phase, and 74%-76% for minima. On an average, the source surface of 3.25 R<SUB>S</SUB> gives the best polarity match. We also find strong evidence for solar cycle variation of the optimal source surface distance, with highest values (3.3 R<SUB>S</SUB>) during solar minima and lowest values (2.6 R<SUB>S</SUB>-2.7 R<SUB>S</SUB>) during the other three solar cycle phases. Raising the number of harmonic terms beyond 2 rarely improves the polarity match, showing that the structure of the HMF at 1 au is most of the time rather simple. All four data sets yield fairly similar polarity matches. Thus, polarity comparison is not affected by photospheric field scaling, unlike comparisons of the field intensity.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922515","page":["63"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...63K","identifier":["2017ApJ...835...63K","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/63","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/63"],"bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Koskela, J.

An analysis of the data shows a persistent presence of active longitudes during the whole 90 years of data. We compared two well-studied analysis methods and presented their results. The separation between the two most active longitudes is found be roughly 180° for the majority of time. Additionally, we also find a comparatively weaker presence of separations at 90° and 270°. The migration pattern of these active longitudes as revealed by our data is found to be consistent with the solar differential rotation curve. We also study the periodicities in the active longitudes and found two dominant periods of ≈1.3 and ≈2.2 years. These periods, also found in other solar proxies, indicate their relation with the global solar dynamo mechanism.","read_count":17,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922514","page":["62"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...62M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mandal, Sudip","Chatterjee, Subhamoy","Banerjee, Dipankar"],"aff":["Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Koramangala, Bangalore 560034, India","Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Koramangala, Bangalore 560034, India","Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Koramangala, Bangalore 560034, India; Center of Excellence in Space Sciences India, IISER Kolkata, Mohanpur 741246, West Bengal, India"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-5014-7022","0000-0003-4653-6823"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/62"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: activity","Sun: oscillations","sunspots","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe authors would like to thank Mr. Gopal Hazra for his useful comments in preparing this manuscript.

An improved activity identification with respect to the previous study was introduced to build a catalog of field stars in the solar neighborhood with an excess emission flux in the calcium infrared triplet wavelength region. The central result of this work is the calibration of the age-activity relation for main-sequence dwarfs in a range from a few 10 {Myr} up to a few Gyr. It enabled an order of magnitude age estimation of the entire active sample. Almost 15,000 stars are shown to be younger than 1 {Gyr} and ̃2000 younger than 100 {Myr}. The young age of the most active stars is confirmed by their position off the main sequence in the J - K versus {N}<SUB>{UV</SUB>}-V diagram showing strong ultraviolet excess, mid-infrared excess in the J - K versus {W}<SUB>1</SUB>-{W}<SUB>2</SUB> diagram, and very cool temperatures (J-K> 0.7). They overlap with the reference pre-main-sequence RAVE stars often displaying X-ray emission. The activity level increasing with the color reveals their different nature from the solar-like stars and probably represents an underlying dynamo-generating magnetic fields in cool stars. Of the RAVE objects from DR5, 50% are found in the TGAS catalog and supplemented with accurate parallaxes and proper motions by Gaia. This makes the database of a large number of young stars in a combination with RAVE’s radial velocities directly useful as a tracer of the very recent large-scale star formation history in the solar neighborhood. The data are available online in the Vizier database.","read_count":40,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922600","page":["61"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...61Z","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Žerjal, M.","Zwitter, T.","Matijevič, G.","Grebel, E.

We have used two implementations of the model: a highly idealized, computationally inexpensive, spherically symmetric semi-analytic model, and a complex, three-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic, simulation; they are in a good mutual agreement. The results confirm our previous findings that, in a cluster with 1G mass 10<SUP>7</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> and half-mass-radius 2.38 pc, the shocked stellar winds become thermally unstable, collapse into dense gaseous structures that partially accumulate inside the cluster, self-shield against ionizing stellar radiation, and form the second generation (2G) of stars. We have used the semi-analytic model to explore a subset of the parameter space covering a wide range of the observationally poorly constrained parameters: the heating efficiency, η<SUB>he</SUB>, and the mass loading, η<SUB>ml</SUB>. The results show that the fraction of the 1G stellar winds accumulating inside the cluster can be larger than 50% if η<SUB>he</SUB> ≲ 10%, which is suggested by the observations. Furthermore, for low η<SUB>he</SUB>, the model provides a self-consistent mechanism predicting 2G stars forming only in the central zones of the cluster. Finally, we have calculated the accumulated warm gas emission in the H30α recombination line, analyzed its velocity profile, and estimated its intensity for super star clusters in interacting galaxies NGC4038/9 (Antennae) showing that the warm gas should be detectable with ALMA.","read_count":43,"citation_count":9,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922589","page":["60"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...60W","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Wünsch, R.","Palouš, J.","Tenorio-Tagle, G.","Ehlerová, S."],"aff":["Astronomical Institute, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Boční II 1401, 141 31 Prague, Czech Republic","Astronomical Institute, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Boční II 1401, 141 31 Prague, Czech Republic","Instituto Nacional de Astrofísica Optica y Electrónica, AP 51, 72000 Puebla, México","Astronomical Institute, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, Boční II 1401, 141 31 Prague, Czech Republic"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-1848-8967","0000-0001-6729-2851","0000-0003-4163-4969","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/60"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["NED:3","SIMBAD:6"],"keyword":["galaxies: ISM","galaxies: star clusters: general","galaxies: star formation","globular clusters: general","H II regions","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the anonymous referee for constructive and valuable comments.

We propose that this is the natural result of accretion driven by magnetized winds. Typical physical conditions of the gas inside these cavities are estimated for plausible X-ray and FUV radiation fields. The gas near the midplane is molecular and predominantly neutral, with a dimensionless ambipolar parameter in the right general range for wind solutions of the type developed by Königl, Wardle, and others. That is to say, the density of ions and electrons is sufficient for moderately good coupling to the magnetic field, but it is not so good that the magnetic flux needs to be dragged inward by the accreting neutrals.","read_count":54,"citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922587","page":["59"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...59W","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Wang, Lile","Goodman, Jeremy J."],"aff":["Princeton University Observatory, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA","Princeton University Observatory, Princeton, NJ 08544, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-6540-7042","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/59"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:4"],"keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","astrochemistry","circumstellar matter","planetary systems","planets and satellites: formation","protoplanetary disks","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the anonymous referee for constructive criticism, particularly regarding estimates of the gas density from the observations.

Both show excess emission at early times and a slowly declining light curve at late times. The early bump in PTF 12dam is very similar in duration (̃10 days) and brightness relative to the main peak (2-3 mag fainter) compared to that observed in other SLSNe I. In contrast, the long-duration (>30 days) early excess emission in iPTF 13dcc, whose brightness competes with that of the main peak, appears to be of a different nature. We construct bolometric light curves for both targets, and fit a variety of light-curve models to both the early bump and main peak in an attempt to understand the nature of these explosions. Even though the slope of the late-time decline in the light curves of both SLSNe is suggestively close to that expected from the radioactive decay of <SUP>56</SUP>Ni and <SUP>56</SUP>Co, the amount of nickel required to power the full light curves is too large considering the estimated ejecta mass. The magnetar model including an increasing escape fraction provides a reasonable description of the PTF 12dam observations. However, neither the basic nor the double-peaked magnetar model is capable of reproducing the light curve of iPTF 13dcc. A model combining a shock breakout in an extended envelope with late-time magnetar energy injection provides a reasonable fit to the iPTF 13dcc observations. Finally, we find that the light curves of both PTF 12dam and iPTF 13dcc can be adequately fit with the model involving interaction with the circumstellar medium.","citation_count":16,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922555","page":["58"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...58V","bibgroup":["Keck","HST","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Vreeswijk, Paul M.","Leloudas, Giorgos","Gal-Yam, Avishay","De Cia, Annalisa","Perley, Daniel A.","Quimby, Robert M.","Waldman, Roni","Sullivan, Mark","Yan, Lin","Ofek, Eran O.","Fremling, Christoffer","Taddia, Francesco","Sollerman, Jesper","Valenti, Stefano","Arcavi, Iair","Howell, D.

Motivated by this source, we perform three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations using a modified version of the GPU-accelerated Adaptive-MEsh-Refinement hydrodynamical parallel code (GAMER) to study colliding extragalactic jets. We find that colliding jets can be cast into two categories: (1) bouncing jets, in which case the jets bounce off each other keeping their identities, and (2) merging jets, when only one jet emerges from the collision. Under some conditions the interaction causes the jets to break up into oscillating filaments of opposite helicity, with consequences for their downstream stability. When one jet is significantly faster than the other and the impact parameter is small, the jets merge; the faster jet takes over the slower one. In the case of merging jets, the oscillations of the filaments, in projection, may show a feature that resembles a double helix, similar to the radio image of 3C 75. Thus we interpret the morphology of 3C 75 as a consequence of the collision of two jets with distinctly different speeds at a small impact parameter, with the faster jet breaking up into two oscillating filaments.","read_count":43,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922567","page":["57"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...57M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Molnar, S.

Previous works have investigated the relationships between SF and cluster substructure, and cluster substructure and supercluster environment, but definitive conclusions relating all three of these variables has remained elusive. We find an inverse relationship between cluster SF fraction (f<SUB>SF</SUB>) and supercluster environment density, calculated using the Galaxy luminosity density field at a smoothing length of 8 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc (D8). The slope of f<SUB>SF</SUB> versus D8 is -0.008 ± 0.002. The f<SUB>SF</SUB> of clusters located in low-density large-scale environments, 0.244 ± 0.011, is higher than for clusters located in high-density supercluster cores, 0.202 ± 0.014. We also divide superclusters, according to their morphology, into filament- and spider-type systems. The inverse relationship between cluster f<SUB>SF</SUB> and large-scale density is dominated by filament- rather than spider-type superclusters. In high-density cores of superclusters, we find a higher f<SUB>SF</SUB> in spider-type superclusters, 0.229 ± 0.016, than in filament-type superclusters, 0.166 ± 0.019. Using principal component analysis, we confirm these results and the direct correlation between cluster substructure and SF. These results indicate that cluster SF is affected by both the dynamical age of the cluster (younger systems exhibit higher amounts of SF); the large-scale density of the supercluster environment (high-density core regions exhibit lower amounts of SF); and supercluster morphology (spider-type superclusters exhibit higher amounts of SF at high densities).","read_count":24,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922574","page":["56"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...56C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Cohen, Seth A.","Hickox, Ryan C.","Wegner, Gary A.","Einasto, Maret","Vennik, Jaan"],"aff":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, Dartmouth College, 6127 Wilder Laboratory, Hanover, NH 03755, USA","Department of Physics and Astronomy, Dartmouth College, 6127 Wilder Laboratory, Hanover, NH 03755, USA","Department of Physics and Astronomy, Dartmouth College, 6127 Wilder Laboratory, Hanover, NH 03755, USA","Tartu Observatory, 61602 Tõravere, Estonia","Tartu Observatory, 61602 Tõravere, Estonia"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-0720-5071","0000-0003-1468-9526","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/56"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: star formation","large-scale structure of universe","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the SDSS team, as well as the MPA/JHU and NYU researchers, for the publicly available data releases and VAGCs.

This survey covered 4.5 deg<SUP>2</SUP> of the SMC with 1σ noise levels of 5-12 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>, and 44 extended objects were identified. The 1.1 mm extended emission has good spatial correlation with Herschel 160 μm, indicating that the origin of the 1.1 mm extended emission is thermal emission from a cold dust component. We estimated physical properties using the 1.1 mm and filtered Herschel data (100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 μm). The 1.1 mm objects show dust temperatures of 17-45 K and gas masses of 4 × 10<SUP>3</SUP>-3 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming single-temperature thermal emission from the cold dust with an emissivity index, β, of 1.2 and a gas-to-dust ratio of 1000. These physical properties are very similar to those of giant molecular clouds (GMCs) in our galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. The 1.1 mm objects also displayed good spatial correlation with the Spitzer 24 μm and CO emission, suggesting that the 1.1 mm objects trace the dense gas regions as sites of massive star formation. The dust temperature of the 1.1 mm objects also demonstrated good correlation with the 24 μm flux connected to massive star formation. This supports the hypothesis that the heating source of the cold dust is mainly local star-formation activity in the 1.1 mm objects. The classification of the 1.1 mm objects based on the existence of star-formation activity reveals the differences in the dust temperature, gas mass, and radius, which reflects the evolution sequence of GMCs.

This is the first magnetar for which such a wind nebula was found. Here, we investigate whether there is a plausible scenario where the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) can be sustained without the need of advocating for additional sources of energy other than rotational. We do this by using a detailed radiative and dynamical code that studies the evolution of the nebula and its particle population in time. We find that such a scenario indeed exists: Swift J1834.9-0846's nebula can be explained as being rotationally powered, as all other known PWNe are, if it is currently being compressed by the environment. The latter introduces several effects, the most important of which is the appearance of adiabatic heating, being increasingly dominant over the escape of particles as reverberation goes by. The need of reverberation naturally explains why this is the only magnetar nebula detected and provides estimates for Swift 1834.9-0846's age.","citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922581","page":["54"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...54T","bibgroup":["CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Torres, Diego F."],"aff":["Institute of Space Sciences (IEEC-CSIC), Campus UAB, Carrer de Magrans s/n, E-08193 Barcelona, Spain; Institució Catalana de Recerca i Estudis Avançats (ICREA), E-08010 Barcelona, Spain"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"1","orcid_other":["0000-0002-1522-9065"],"volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/54"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["HEASARC:1","SIMBAD:18"],"keyword":["pulsars: individual: Swift J1834.9─0846","pulsars: general","stars: magnetars","ISM: supernova remnants","ISM: jets and outflows","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe acknowledge support from the grants AYA2015-71042-P, SGR 2014-1073 and the National Natural Science Foundation of China via grant NSFC 11473027, and Y.

The main goal is to put more constraints on the object’s fundamental parameters, as well as on its nature and evolutionary state. Absorption lines in the spectrum of HD 85567 were found to be similar to those of mid-B-type dwarfs and correspond to the following fundamental parameters: T<SUB>eff</SUB> = 15,000 ± 500 K, v\\sin I=31+/- 3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, and {log} g̃ 4.0. The interstellar extinction, A<SUB>V</SUB> = 0.50 ± 0.02 mag, was measured using the strengths of some diffuse interstellar bands. We also obtained UBV(RI)<SUB>c</SUB> images of a 10′ × 10′ region around the object. Photometry of projectionally close stars was used to derive an interstellar extinction law in this direction and resulted in a distance of 1300 ± 100 pc to the object and a luminosity of log L/L<SUB>☉</SUB> = 3.3 ± 0.2. We found no significant radial velocity variations of the absorption lines in the spectra of HD 85567 obtained during two-month-long periods of time in 2012 and 2015. Our analysis of the spectroscopic and photometric data available for the star led us to a conclusion that it cannot be a pre-main-sequence Herbig Ae/Be star. We argue that the circumstellar gas and dust were produced during the object’s evolution as most likely a binary system, which contains an undetected secondary component and is unlikely to be a merger product.

The basic statistical characteristics of a stochastic process (first-order moments, an autocorrelation function and a power spectral density) are used to describe a light ray deflection in a gravitational field of randomly moving point masses as a function of the source coordinates. We map a 2D distribution of the standard deviation of the angular shifts in positions of distant sources (including reference sources of the International Celestial Reference Frame) with respect to their true positions. For different Galactic matter distributions the standard deviation of the offset angle can reach several tens of μas (microarcsecond) toward the Galactic center, decreasing down to 4-6 μas at high galactic latitudes. The conditional standard deviation (“jitter”) of 2.5 μas is reached within 10 years at high galactic latitudes and within a few months toward the inner part of the Galaxy. The photometric microlensing events are not expected to be disturbed by astrometric random variations anywhere except the inner part of the Galaxy as the Einstein-Chvolson times are typically much shorter than the jittering timescale. While a jitter of a single reference source can be up to dozens of μas over some reasonable observational time, using a sample of reference sources would reduce the error in relative astrometry. The obtained results can be used for estimating the physical upper limits on the time-dependent accuracy of astrometric measurements.","read_count":28,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922588","page":["51"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...51L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Larchenkova, Tatiana I.","Lutovinov, Alexander A.","Lyskova, Natalya S."],"aff":["ASC of P.N.Lebedev Physical Institute, Leninskiy prospect 53, Moscow 119991, Russia","Space Research Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Profsoyuznaya 84/32, 117997 Moscow, Russia; Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology, Moscow region, Dolgoprudnyi, Russia","Space Research Institute, Russian Academy of Sciences, Profsoyuznaya 84/32, 117997 Moscow, Russia; Max-Planck-Institut für Astrophysik, Karl-Schwarzschild-Strasse 1, D-85741 Garching, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-6255-9972","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/51"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:8"],"keyword":["astrometry","Galaxy: general","gravitation","reference systems","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis work was supported by the Russian Science Foundation (grant 14-22-00271).

Recent articles have proposed both AGB stars and SNe II as the dominant sources of fluorine in the solar neighborhood. In this paper we set out to determine the fluorine abundance in a sample of 49 nearby, bright K giants for which we previously have determined the stellar parameters, as well as alpha abundances homogeneously from optical high-resolution spectra. The fluorine abundance is determined from a 2.3 μm HF molecular line observed with the spectrometer Phoenix. We compare the fluorine abundances with those of alpha-elements mainly produced in SNe II and find that fluorine and the alpha-elements do not evolve in lockstep, ruling out SNe II as the dominating producers of fluorine in the solar neighborhood. Furthermore, we find a secondary behavior of fluorine with respect to oxygen, which is another evidence against the SNe II playing a large role in the production of fluorine in the solar neighborhood. This secondary behavior of fluorine will put new constraints on stellar models of the other two suggested production sites: AGB stars and W-R stars.","read_count":29,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922606","page":["50"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...50J","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Jönsson, H.","Ryde, N.","Spitoni, E.","Matteucci, F.","Cunha, K.","Smith, V.","Hinkle, K.","Schultheis, M."],"aff":["Lund Observatory, Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics, Lund University, Box 43, SE-22100 Lund, Sweden; Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), E-38205 La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain; Universidad de La Laguna, Dpto.

We define a performance objective of 1 mK residual rms after modeling foreground subtraction from a fiducial temperature spectrum using a five-term polynomial. Most of the calibration uncertainties yield residuals of 1 mK or less at 95 % confidence. However, current uncertainties in the antenna and receiver reflection coefficients can lead to residuals of up to 20 mK even in low-foreground sky regions. These dominant residuals could be reduced by (1) improving the accuracy in reflection measurements, especially their phase, (2) improving the impedance match at the antenna-receiver interface, and (3) decreasing the changes with frequency of the antenna reflection phase.","read_count":40,"citation_count":10,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922545","page":["49"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...49M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Monsalve, Raul A.","Rogers, Alan E.

One mechanism proposed to explain the observations is electron acceleration within contracting magnetic islands formed by magnetic reconnection in the flare current sheet. In a previous study, a numerical magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an eruptive solar flare was analyzed to estimate the associated electron acceleration due to island contraction. That analysis used a simple analytical model for the island structure and assumed conservation of the adiabatic invariants of particle motion. In this paper, we perform the first-ever rigorous integration of the guiding-center orbits of electrons in a modeled flare. An initially isotropic distribution of particles is seeded in a contracting island from the simulated eruption, and the subsequent evolution of these particles is followed using guiding-center theory. We find that the distribution function becomes increasingly anisotropic over time as the electrons’ energy increases by up to a factor of five, in general agreement with the previous study. In addition, we show that the energized particles are concentrated on the Sunward side of the island, adjacent to the reconnection X-point in the flare current sheet. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that the electron energy gain is dominated by betatron acceleration in the compressed, strengthened magnetic field of the contracting island. Fermi acceleration by the shortened field lines of the island also contributes to the energy gain, but it is less effective than the betatron process.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922570","page":["48"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...48B","identifier":["2017ApJ...835...48B","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/48","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/48"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Borovikov, D.","Tenishev, V.","Gombosi, T.

A detailed statistical analysis of their temporal behavior and spatial properties is carried out in this work. Using state-of-the-art spatial and temporal resolution observations, yielded by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly of Solar Dynamics Observatory, we constructed a database covering a 5.5 year long period, containing 301 macrospicules that occurred between 2010 June and 2015 December, detected at 30.4 nm wavelength. Here, we report the long-term variation of the height, length, average speed, and width of MS in coronal holes and Quiet Sun areas both in the northern and southern hemisphere of the Sun. This new database helps to refine our knowledge about the physical properties of MSs. Cross-correlation of these properties shows a relatively strong correlation, but not always a dominant one. However, a more detailed analysis indicates a wave-like signature in the behavior of MS properties in time. The periods of these long-term oscillatory behaviors are just under two years. Also, in terms of solar north/south hemispheres, a strong asymmetry was found in the spatial distribution of MS properties, which may be accounted for by the solar dynamo. This latter feature may then indicate a strong and rather intrinsic link between global internal and local atmospheric phenomena in the Sun.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922565","page":["47"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...47K","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kiss, T.

Blazars are one class of extragalactic sources which may produce such high-energy neutrinos. We present a likelihood analysis searching for cumulative neutrino emission from blazars in the 2nd Fermi-LAT AGN catalog (2LAC) using IceCube neutrino data set 2009-12, which was optimized for the detection of individual sources. In contrast to those in previous searches with IceCube, the populations investigated contain up to hundreds of sources, the largest one being the entire blazar sample in the 2LAC catalog. No significant excess is observed, and upper limits for the cumulative flux from these populations are obtained. These constrain the maximum contribution of 2LAC blazars to the observed astrophysical neutrino flux to 27% or less between around 10 TeV and 2 PeV, assuming the equipartition of flavors on Earth and a single power-law spectrum with a spectral index of -2.5. We can still exclude the fact that 2LAC blazars (and their subpopulations) emit more than 50% of the observed neutrinos up to a spectral index as hard as -2.2 in the same energy range. Our result takes into account the fact that the neutrino source count distribution is unknown, and it does not assume strict proportionality of the neutrino flux to the measured 2LAC γ-ray signal for each source. Additionally, we constrain recent models for neutrino emission by blazars.","read_count":130,"citation_count":24,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922593","page":["45"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...45A","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Aartsen, M.

However, spectral evidence that MACS0647-JD lies at high redshift has proven infeasible and so here we seek an independent-lensing-based “geometric redshift” derived from the angles between the three lensed images of MACS0647-JD, using our free-form mass model (WSLAP+) for the lensing cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015 (at z = 0.591). Our lens model uses the nine sets of multiple images, including those of MACS0647-JD, identified by the CLASH survey toward this cluster. We convincingly exclude the low-redshift regime of z < 3, for which convoluted critical curves are generated by our method, as the solution bends to accommodate the wide angles of MACS0647-JD for this low redshift. Instead, a best fit to all sets of lensed galaxy positions and redshifts provides a geometric redshift of z≃ {10.8}<SUB>-0.4</SUB><SUP>+0.3</SUP> for MACS0647-JD, strongly supporting the higher photometric redshift solution. Importantly, we find a tight linear relation between the relative brightnesses of all nine sets of multiply lensed images and their relative magnifications as predicted by our model. This agreement provides a benchmark for the quality of the lens model, and establishes the robustness of our free-form lensing method for measuring model-independent geometric source distances and for deriving objective central cluster mass distributions. After correcting for its magnification the luminosity of MACS0647-JD remains relatively high at M<SUB>UV</SUB> = -19.4, which is within a factor of a few in flux of some surprisingly luminous z ≃ 10-11 candidates discovered recently in Hubble blank field surveys.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922518","page":["44"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...44C","bibgroup":["HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Chan, Brian M.

The initiation process incorporates the following phenomena: an X-ray precursor that started ̃9 minutes before flare onset, two hot magnetic loops (as seen with AIA hot channels) forming a sigmoidal core magnetic structure (as seen with the EUVI), a rapidly formed magnetic flux rope (MFR) that expands outward, and a flare loop that contracts inward. The two hot magnetic loops were activated after the occurrence of the X-ray precursor. After activation, magnetic reconnection occurred between the two hot magnetic loops (inside the sigmoid structure), which produced the expanding MFR and the contracting flare loop (CFL). The MFR and CFL can only be seen with AIA hot and cool channels, respectively. For this flare, the real initiation time can be regarded as being from the starting time of the precursor, and its impulsive phase started when the MFR began its fast expansion. In addition, the CFL and the growing postflare magnetic loops are different loop systems, and the CFL was the product of magnetic reconnection between sheared magnetic fields that also produced the MFR.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922563","page":["43"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...43S","identifier":["2017ApJ...835...43S","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/43","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/43"],"bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Shen, Jinhua","Wang, Ya","Zhou, Tuanhui","Ji, Haisheng"],"aff":["Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory, CAS, 830011, Urumqi, China; Key Laboratory of Solar Activity, NAO, CAS, Beijing 100012, China;","Purple Mountain Observatory, CAS, Nanjing, 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China","Purple Mountain Observatory, CAS, Nanjing, 210008, China; Key Lab for DMSA, CAS, Nanjing, 210008, China","Purple Mountain Observatory, CAS, Nanjing, 210008, China; Key Lab for DMSA, CAS, Nanjing, 210008, China"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-4439-4972","-","0000-0001-8224-6941","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/43"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: activity","Sun: flares","sunspots"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe authors would like to thank the anonymous referee for helping to improve the quality of the paper.

The photon spectrum of this source is best described by a power law with an index of 1.85 ± 0.17 in the energy range of 3-500 GeV, and the measured flux connects smoothly with that of HESS J1427-608 at a few hundred gigaelectronvolts. This source shows no significant extension and time variation. The broadband GeV to TeV emission over four decades of energies can be well fitted by a single power-law function with an index of 2.0, without obvious indication of spectral cutoff toward high energies. Such a result implies that HESS J1427-608 may be a PeV particle accelerator. We discuss the possible nature of HESS J1427-608 according to the multiwavelength spectral fittings. Given the relatively large errors, either a leptonic or a hadronic model can explain the multiwavelength data from radio to VHE γ-rays. The inferred magnetic field strength is a few micro-Gauss, which is smaller than the typical values of supernova remnants (SNRs) and is consistent with some pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe). On the other hand, the flat γ-ray spectrum is slightly different from typical PWNe but is similar to that of some known SNRs.","read_count":59,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922549","page":["42"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...42G","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Guo, Xiao-Lei","Xin, Yu-Liang","Liao, Neng-Hui","Yuan, Qiang","Gao, Wei-Hong","He, Hao-Ning","Fan, Yi-Zhong","Liu, Si-Ming"],"aff":["Department of Physics and Institute of Theoretical Physics, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210046, China; Key Laboratory of Dark Matter and Space Astronomy, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China;","Key Laboratory of Dark Matter and Space Astronomy, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Yuquan Road 19, Beijing, 100049, China;","Key Laboratory of Dark Matter and Space Astronomy, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","Key Laboratory of Dark Matter and Space Astronomy, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","Department of Physics and Institute of Theoretical Physics, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210046, China","Key Laboratory of Dark Matter and Space Astronomy, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","Key Laboratory of Dark Matter and Space Astronomy, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","Key Laboratory of Dark Matter and Space Astronomy, Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","0000-0001-6614-3344","-","-","-","0000-0002-8966-6911","0000-0003-1039-9521"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/42"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:20"],"keyword":["gamma rays: general","gamma rays: ISM","ISM: individual objects: HESS J1427−608","ISM: supernova remnants","radiation mechanisms: nonthermal","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis work is supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province of China (No. BK2014102SBZ0140), the 973 Programme of China (No. 2013CB837000), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Nos. 11433009, 11233001 and 11303098), the Strategic Priority Research Program, the Emergence of Cosmological Structures, of the Chinese Academy (No. XDB09000000), and the 100 Talents program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.\n","doctype":"article","title":["HESS J1427-608: An Unusual Hard, Unbroken Gamma-Ray Spectrum in a Very Wide Energy Range"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-10T19:14:12.654Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv160806867G"],"identifier":["2016arXiv160806867G","2017ApJ...835...41G","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/41","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/41","2016arXiv160806867G","1608.06867"],"first_author":"González-Casanova, Diego F.","abstract":"Strong Alfvénic turbulence develops eddy-like motions perpendicular to the local direction of magnetic fields.

We test our idea by employing the synthetic observations obtained via 3D magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) numerical simulations for different sonic and Alfvén Mach numbers. We calculate the velocity gradient, {\\boldsymbol{Ω }}, using the velocity centroids. We find that {\\boldsymbol{Ω }} traces the projected magnetic field best for the synthetic maps obtained with sub-Alfvénic simulations and provides good point-wise correspondence between the magnetic field direction and the direction of {\\boldsymbol{Ω }}. The reported alignment is much better than the alignment between the density gradients and the magnetic field, and we demonstrate that it can be used to find the magnetic field strength with an analog of the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method.

These solutions exhibit a number of remarkable features, including the self-consistent formation of and subsequent accretion onto a central point mass. A number of specific examples are provided, and we show that Penston’s solution of pressureless self-similar collapse is recovered for polytropic density profiles; importantly, however, we demonstrate that the time over which this solution holds is fleetingly short, implying that much of the collapse proceeds non-self-similarly. We show that our solutions can naturally incorporate turbulent pressure support, and we investigate the evolution of overdensities—potentially generated by such turbulence—as the collapse proceeds. Finally, we analyze the evolution of the angular velocity and magnetic fields in the limit that their dynamical influence is small, and we recover exact solutions for these quantities. Our results may provide important constraints on numerical models that attempt to elucidate the details of protostellar collapse when the initial conditions are far less idealized.","read_count":70,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922575","page":["40"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...40C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Coughlin, Eric R."],"aff":["Astronomy Department and Theoretical Astrophysics Center, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/40"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["galaxies: formation","gravitation","magnetohydrodynamics: MHD","methods: analytical","stars: formation","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nSupport for this work was provided by NASA through the Einstein Fellowship Program, grant PF6-170150.

We obtain a dipolar solution within a certain range of parameters. We use this model to study the build-up of the polar magnetic field and show that some insights obtained from surface flux transport models have to be revised. We present results obtained by putting a single bipolar sunspot pair in a hemisphere and two symmetrical sunspot pairs in two hemispheres. We find that the polar fields produced by them disappear due to the upward advection of poloidal flux at low latitudes, which emerges as oppositely signed radial flux and which is then advected poleward by the meridional flow. We also study the effect that a large sunspot pair, violating Hale’s polarity law, would have on the polar field. We find that there would be some effect—especially if the anti-Hale pair appears at high latitudes in the mid-phase of the cycle—though the effect is not very dramatic.","read_count":14,"citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922537","page":["39"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...39H","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Hazra, Gopal","Choudhuri, Arnab Rai","Miesch, Mark S."],"aff":["Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India; Indian Institute of Astrophysics, Bangalore, 560034, India;","Department of Physics, Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, 560012, India","High Altitude Observatory, National Center for Atmospheric Research, Boulder, CO 80301, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","0000-0003-1976-0811"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/39"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: activity","Sun: interior","Sun: magnetic fields","sunspots","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["A Theoretical Study of the Build-up of the Sun’s Polar Magnetic Field by using a 3D Kinematic Dynamo Model"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T21:42:49.339Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161200446D"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161200446D","2017ApJ...835...38D","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/38","2016arXiv161200446D","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/38","1612.00446"],"first_author":"Dong, Ruobing","abstract":"Recently, high angular resolution imaging instruments such as SPHERE and GPI have discovered many spiral-arm-like features in near-infrared scattered-light images of protoplanetary disks. Theory and simulations have suggested that these arms are most likely excited by planets forming in the disks; however, a quantitative relation between the arm-to-disk brightness contrast and planet mass is still missing. Using 3D hydrodynamics and radiative transfer simulations, we examine the morphology and contrast of planet-induced arms in disks. We find a power-law relation for the face-on arm contrast (δ<SUB>max</SUB>) as a function of planet mass ({M}<SUB>{{p</SUB>}}) and disk aspect ratio (h/r): {δ }<SUB>\\max </SUB>≈ {({({M}<SUB>{{p</SUB>}}/{M}<SUB>{{J</SUB>}})/(h/r)}<SUP>1.38</SUP>)}<SUP>0.22</SUP>. With current observational capabilities, at a 30 au separation, the minimum planet mass for driving detectable arms in a disk around a 1 Myr, 1 {M}<SUB>☉ </SUB> star at 140 pc at low inclinations is around Saturn mass. For planets more massive than Neptune masses, they typically drive multiple arms. Therefore, in observed disks with spirals, it is unlikely that each spiral arm originates from a different planet.

Additionally, we find that the morphology and contrast of the primary and secondary arms are largely unaffected by a modest level of viscosity with α ≲ 0.01.

We achieve this goal in a model-independent way by exploiting the SFR functions derived by Mancuso et al. on the basis of an educated extrapolation of the latest UV/far-IR data from HST/Herschel, and already tested against a number of independent observables.

The minifilament, which lies at the periphery of active region 12259, is detected by Hα images from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope. The minifilament undergoes a partial and then a full eruption. Simultaneously, two co-spatial jets are successively observed in extreme ultraviolet images from the Solar Dynamic Observatory. The first jet exhibits a typical fan-spine geometry, suggesting that the co-spatial minifilament is possibly embedded in magnetic fields with a fan-spine structure. However, the second jet displays blowout morphology when the entire minifilament erupts upward, leaving behind a hard X-ray emission source in the base. Differential emission measure analyses show that the eruptive region is heated up to about 4 MK during the fan-spine jet, while up to about 7 MK during the blowout jet. In particular, the blowout jet is accompanied by an interplanetary type-III radio burst observed by WIND/WAVES in the frequency range from above 10 to 0.1 MHz. Hence, the minifilament eruption is correlated with the interplanetary type-III radio burst for the first time. These results not only suggest that coronal jets can result from magnetic reconnection initiated by erupting minifilaments with open fields, but also shed light on the potential influence of minifilament eruption on interplanetary space.","citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922573","page":["35"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...35H","identifier":["2017ApJ...835...35H","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/35","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/35"],"bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Hong, Junchao","Jiang, Yunchun","Yang, Jiayan","Li, Haidong","Xu, Zhe"],"aff":["Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 396 Yangfangwang, Guandu District, Kunming, 650216, China; Center for Astronomical Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20A Datun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100012, China","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 396 Yangfangwang, Guandu District, Kunming, 650216, China; Center for Astronomical Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20A Datun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100012, China","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 396 Yangfangwang, Guandu District, Kunming, 650216, China; Center for Astronomical Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20A Datun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100012, China","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 396 Yangfangwang, Guandu District, Kunming, 650216, China; Center for Astronomical Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20A Datun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100012, China","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 396 Yangfangwang, Guandu District, Kunming, 650216, China; Center for Astronomical Mega-Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20A Datun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing, 100012, China"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-3804-7395","0000-0002-2731-5112","0000-0003-3462-4340","-","0000-0002-9121-9686"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/35"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: chromosphere","Sun: corona","Sun: filaments","prominences"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the referee for valuable suggestions and comments that greatly improved the paper.

However, it is unknown what determines the maximum energy of accelerated particles. The surrounding environment could be one of the key parameters. The SNR RCW 86 shows both thermal and nonthermal X-ray emission with different spatial morphologies. These emission originate from the shock-heated plasma and accelerated electrons respectively, and their intensities reflect their density distributions. Thus, the remnant provides a suitable laboratory to test possible association between the acceleration efficiency and the environment. In this paper, we present results of spatially resolved spectroscopy of the entire remnant with Suzaku. The spacially resolved spectra are well reproduced with a combination of a power-law for synchrotron emission and a two-component optically thin thermal plasma, corresponding to the shocked interstellar medium (ISM) with kT of 0.3-0.6 keV and Fe-dominated ejecta. It is discovered that the photon index of the nonthermal component becomes smaller when decreasing the emission measure of the shocked ISM, where the shock speed has remained high. This result implies that the maximum energy of accelerated electrons in RCW 86 is higher in the low-density and higher shock speed regions.","read_count":34,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922594","page":["34"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...34T","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Tsubone, Yoshio","Sawada, Makoto","Bamba, Aya","Katsuda, Satoru","Vink, Jacco"],"aff":["Department of Physics and Mathematics, Aoyama Gakuin University 5-10-1 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5258, Japan","Department of Physics and Mathematics, Aoyama Gakuin University 5-10-1 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5258, Japan","Department of Physics and Mathematics, Aoyama Gakuin University 5-10-1 Fuchinobe, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5258, Japan; Department of Physics, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan; Research Center for the Early Universe, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan","Department of Physics, Faculty of Science & Engineering, Chuo University, 1-13-27 Kasuga, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 112-8551, Japan","Anton Pannekoek Institute/GRAPPA, University of Amsterdam P.O.

Applying the equation of state in the Skyrme framework for the neutron matter (NM), we calculate the mass-radius relation for different DMANSs with various DMEOSs and central pressure of dark matter (DM) to NM ratios. Our results show that for some DMEOSs, the mass-radius relations are in agreement with new observations, e.g., EXO 1745-248, 4U 1608-52, and 4U 1820-30, which are inconsistent with normal neutron stars. We conclude that both DMEOSs and central pressure ratios of DM to NM affect the slope of the mass-radius relation of DMANSs. This is because of the interaction between DM and NM, which leads to gravitationally or self-bound DMANSs. We study the radius of the NM sphere as well as the radius of the DM halo for different DMANSs. The results confirm that, in some cases, a NM sphere with a small radius is surrounded by a halo of DM with a larger radius. Our calculations verify that, due to the different degrees of DM domination in DMANSs, with a value of the visible radius of a star two possible DMANSs with different masses can exist. The gravitational redshift is also calculated for DMANSs with different DMEOSs and central pressure ratios. The results explain that the existence of DM in a DMANS leads to higher values of gravitational redshift of the star.","read_count":44,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922508","page":["33"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...33R","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Rezaei, Z."],"aff":["Physics Department and Biruni Observatory College of Sciences, Shiraz University Shiraz 71454, Iran"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.1088/1361-6528/aa5273"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:4"],"keyword":["dark matter","equation of state","galaxies: halos","galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","stars: neutron","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","85"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe author wishes to thank the Shiraz University Research Council and the Iran Science Elites Federation.\n","doctype":"article","title":["Study of Dark-matter Admixed Neutron Stars Using the Equation of State from the Rotational Curves of Galaxies"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T20:19:37.289Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161008856T"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161008856T","2017ApJ...835...32T","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/32","2016arXiv161008856T","1610.08856","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/32"],"first_author":"Tanaka, Kei E.

In particular, the LIGO detectors are most sensitive to sources above North America and the Indian Ocean, and as the Earth rotates, the sensitive regions are swept across the sky. However, because the detectors do not acquire data uniformly over time, there is a net bias on detectable sources’ right ascensions. Both LIGO detectors preferentially collect data during their local night; it is more than twice as likely to be local midnight than noon when both detectors are operating. We discuss these selection effects and how they impact LIGO’s observations and electromagnetic (EM) follow-up. Beyond galactic foregrounds associated with seasonal variations, we find that equatorial observatories can access over 80% of the localization probability, while mid-latitudes will access closer to 70%. Facilities located near the two LIGO sites can observe sources closer to their zenith than their analogs in the south, but the average observation will still be no closer than 44° from zenith. We also find that observatories in Africa or the South Atlantic will wait systematically longer before they can begin observing compared to the rest of the world though, there is a preference for longitudes near the LIGOs. These effects, along with knowledge of the LIGO antenna pattern, can inform EM follow-up activities and optimization, including the possibility of directing observations even before gravitational-wave events occur.","read_count":42,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922543","page":["31"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...31C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Chen, Hsin-Yu","Essick, Reed","Vitale, Salvatore","Holz, Daniel E.","Katsavounidis, Erik"],"aff":["University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA","LIGO, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA","LIGO, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA","University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA","LIGO, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-5403-3762","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/31"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["gravitational waves","methods: observational","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe authors want to thank Lisa Barsotti, Matt Evans, and Rich Middleman for discussions about locking behavior, commissioning, and anthropogenic noise sources, James Annis for discussions about EM observations, and Marica Branchesi for very helpful comments.

The Galactic model has an extended thick disk representing the so-called warm interstellar medium, a thin disk representing the Galactic molecular ring, spiral arms based on a recent fit to Galactic H II regions, a Galactic Center disk, and seven local features including the Gum Nebula, Galactic Loop I, and the Local Bubble. An offset of the Sun from the Galactic plane and a warp of the outer Galactic disk are included in the model. Parameters of the Galactic model are determined by fitting to 189 pulsars with independently determined distances and DMs. Simple models are used for the Magellanic Clouds and the IGM. Galactic model distances are within the uncertainty range for 86 of the 189 independently determined distances and within 20% of the nearest limit for a further 38 pulsars. We estimate that 95% of predicted Galactic pulsar distances will have a relative error of less than a factor of 0.9. The predictions of YMW16 are compared to those of the TC93 and NE2001 models showing that YMW16 performs significantly better on all measures.

We obtain rest-frame optical spectra of galaxies and AGNs and use the BPT diagram to identify optical AGNs. We examine the uniqueness and overlap of the AGNs identified at different wavelengths. There is a strong bias against identifying AGNs at any wavelength in low-mass galaxies, and an additional bias against identifying IR AGNs in the most massive galaxies. AGN hosts span a wide range of star formation rates (SFRs), similar to inactive galaxies once stellar mass selection effects are accounted for. However, we find (at ̃2-3σ significance) that IR AGNs are in less dusty galaxies with relatively higher SFR and optical AGNs in dusty galaxies with relatively lower SFR. X-ray AGN selection does not display a bias with host galaxy SFR. These results are consistent with those from larger studies at lower redshifts. Within star-forming galaxies, once selection biases are accounted for, we find AGNs in galaxies with similar physical properties as inactive galaxies, with no evidence for AGN activity in particular types of galaxies. This is consistent with AGNs being fueled stochastically in any star-forming host galaxy. We do not detect a significant correlation between SFR and AGN luminosity for individual AGN hosts, which may indicate the timescale difference between the growth of galaxies and their supermassive black holes.","citation_count":15,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921988","page":["27"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...27A","bibgroup":["Keck","Spitzer","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Azadi, Mojegan","Coil, Alison L.","Aird, James","Reddy, Naveen","Shapley, Alice","Freeman, William R.","Kriek, Mariska","Leung, Gene C.

We perform two-dimensional light profile fits to GOODS iz images of ̃5000 galaxies and X-ray selected active galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts in the CANDELS/GOODS-north and south fields in the redshift range 0.7< z< 1.3. Distinguishing between bulge-dominated and disk-dominated morphologies, we find that disks and spheroids have distinct color-mass distributions, in agreement with studies at z̃ 0. The smooth distribution across colors for the disk galaxies corresponds to a slow exhaustion of gas, with no fast quenching event. Meanwhile, blue spheroids most likely come from major mergers of star-forming disk galaxies, and the dearth of spheroids at intermediate green colors is suggestive of rapid quenching. The distribution of moderate luminosity X-ray AGN hosts is even across colors, in contrast, and we find similar numbers and distributions among the two morphology types with no apparent dependence on Eddington ratio. The high fraction of bulge-dominated galaxies that host an AGN in the blue cloud and green valley is consistent with the scenario in which the AGN is triggered after a major merger, and the host galaxy then quickly evolves into the green valley.

Models based on inverse Compton scattering off cosmic microwave background photons by relativistically beamed jets have recently been ruled out, since Fermi LAT observations for 3C 273 and PKS 0637-752 give the upper limit far below the model prediction. Synchrotron emission from a separate electron population with multi-hundred TeV energies remains a possibility although its origin is not well known. We examine a photo-hadronic origin of such high energy electrons/positrons, assuming that protons are accelerated up to 10<SUP>19</SUP> eV and produce electrons/positrons through a Bethe-Heitler process and photo-pion production. These secondary electrons/positrons are injected at sufficiently high energies and produce X-rays and γ-rays by synchrotron radiation without conflicting with the Fermi LAT upper limits. We find that the resultant spectrum well reproduces the X-ray observations from PKS 0637-752, if the proton power is at least {10}<SUP>49</SUP> {erg} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is highly super-Eddington. It is noted that the X-ray emission originates primarily from leptons through a Bethe-Heitler process, while leptons from photo-pion origin lose energy directly through synchrotron emission of multi-TeV photons rather than cascading. To avoid the overproduction of the optical flux, optical emission is primarily due to synchrotron emission of secondary leptons rather than primary electrons, or a mild degree of beaming of the jet is needed if it is owing to the primary electrons. Proton synchrotron luminosity is a few orders of magnitude smaller.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921951","page":["20"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...20K","bibgroup":["CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kusunose, Masaaki","Takahara, Fumio"],"aff":["Department of Physics, School of Science and Technology, Kwansei Gakuin University, Gakuen 2-1, Sanda, Hyogo, 669-1337, Japan","Department of Earth and Space Science, Graduate School of Science, Osaka University, Machikaneyama 1-1, Toyonaka, Osaka 560-0043, Japan"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-2465-7571","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/20"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["NED:1","SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["galaxies: jets","quasars: general","quasars: individual: PKS 0637-752","radiation mechanisms: non-thermal","X-rays: galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe are grateful to the referee for useful comments that improved the manuscript considerably.\n","doctype":"article","read_count":16,"title":["A Photohadronic Model of the Large-scale Jet of PKS 0637-752"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-09T00:07:41.521Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161104640S"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161104640S","2017ApJ...835...19S","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/19","1611.04640","2016arXiv161104640S","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/19"],"first_author":"Su, Yuanyuan","abstract":"The Fornax Cluster is the nearest (≤slant 20 Mpc) galaxy cluster in the southern sky.

The sharp leading edge of NGC 1404 forms a classical “cold front” that separates 0.6 keV dense interstellar medium and 1.5 keV diffuse ICM. We measure the angular pressure variation along the cold front using a very deep (670 ks) Chandra X-ray observation. We are taking the classical approach—using stagnation pressure to determine a substructure’s speed—to the next level by not only deriving a general speed but also directionality, which yields the complete velocity field as well as the distance of the substructure directly from the pressure distribution. We find a hydrodynamic model consistent with the pressure jump along NGC 1404's atmosphere measured in multiple directions. The best-fit model gives an inclination of 33° and a Mach number of 1.3 for the infall of NGC 1404, in agreement with complementary measurements of the motion of NGC 1404. Our study demonstrates the successful treatment of a highly ionized ICM as ideal fluid flow, in support of the hypothesis that magnetic pressure is not dynamically important over most of the virial region of galaxy clusters.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922027","page":["19"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...19S","bibgroup":["CXC","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Su, Yuanyuan","Kraft, Ralph P.","Nulsen, Paul E.

However, their development on accretion flows with advection is insignificant. In this paper, we investigate the effect of advection in the occurrence of RWI through accretion flows around black holes (BHs). In the absence of advection, the occurrence of RWI is extremely low because of high viscosity in the accretion flows around BHs. The results of this paper show that there is a significant chance for the occurrence of RWI in some wavelengths if we consider advection even in low amounts. Therefore, the RWI can be a suitable candidate for angular momentum transport in the accretion flows around BHs. Also, the results show that the advection parameter and the ratio of heat capacity, which are special characters of advection flows, play important roles in the occurrence of RWI.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922040","page":["18"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...18G","identifier":["2017ApJ...835...18G","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/18","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/18"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Gholipour, Mahmoud"],"aff":["Research Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics of Maragha (RIAAM)-Maragha, P.O.

A total of 1299 bright rotating stars were recovered from the subset of Gaia sources with good astrometric solutions, most with temperatures above 5000 K. From these sources, 894 were selected as lying near the main sequence using their absolute G-band magnitudes. These main-sequence stars show a bimodality in their rotation period distribution, centered roughly around a 600 Myr rotation isochrone. This feature matches the bimodal period distribution found in cooler stars with Kepler, but was previously undetected for solar-type stars due to sample contamination by subgiants. A tenuous connection between the rotation period and total proper motion is found, suggesting that the period bimodality is due to the age distribution of stars within ̃300 pc of the Sun, rather than a phase of rapid angular momentum loss. This work emphasizes the unique power for understanding stellar populations that is created by combining temporal monitoring from Kepler with astrometric data from Gaia.","read_count":42,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921969","page":["16"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...16D","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Davenport, James R.

Mass input comes from stellar evolution; energy input includes Type Ia (SNIa) and II supernovae and stellar heating; star formation (SF) is included. Realistic, axisymmetric dynamical galaxy models are built solving the Jeans’ equations. The lowest mass models ({M}<SUB>\\star </SUB>=8 {10}<SUP>10</SUP> {M}<SUB>☉ </SUB>) develop global outflows sustained by SNIa heating, ending with a lower amount of hot gas and new stars. In more massive models, nuclear outbursts last to the present epoch, with large and frequent fluctuations in nuclear emission and from the gas ({L}<SUB>{{X</SUB>}}). Each burst lasts ̃ {10}<SUP>7.5</SUP> years, during which cold, inflowing, and hot, outflowing gas phases coexist.

Roughly half of the total mass loss is recycled into new stars ({{∆ }}{M}<SUB>\\star </SUB>), just ≃3% of it is accreted on the MBH, the remainder being ejected from the galaxy.

Our work follows from the insight of Stenflo, who examined only linear polarization signals in photospheric lines, thereby avoiding complications of the analysis arising from the differing responses to linear and circular polarization. We identify and isolate regions of a strong polarization signal that occupy only a few percent of the observed quiet Sun area yet contribute most to the net linear polarization signal. The center-to-limb variation of the orientation of linear polarization in these strong signal regions indicates that the associated magnetic fields have a dominant vertical orientation. In contrast, the great majority of the solar disk is occupied by much weaker linear polarization signals. The orientation of the linear polarization in these regions demonstrates that the field orientation is dominantly horizontal throughout the photosphere. We also apply our analysis to Stokes profiles synthesized from the numerical MHD simulations of Rempel as viewed at various oblique angles. The analysis of the synthetic data closely follows that of the observations, lending confidence to using the simulations as a guide for understanding the physical origins of the center-to-limb variation of linear polarization in the quiet Sun area.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921964","page":["14"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...14L","identifier":["2017ApJ...835...14L","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/14","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/14"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Lites, B.

However, interpretation of these images is difficult because the degree of polarization is highly sensitive to the angle of scattering of stellar light off the disk surface. We examine how disks with and without gaps created by planets appear in scattered polarized light as a function of inclination angle. Isophotes of inclined disks without gaps are distorted in polarized light, giving the appearance that the disks are more eccentric or more highly inclined than they truly are. Apparent gap locations are unaffected by polarization, but the gap contrast changes. In face-on disks with gaps, we find that the brightened far edge of the gap scatters less polarized light than the rest of the disk, resulting in slightly decreased contrast between the gap trough and the brightened far edge. In inclined disks, gaps can take on the appearance of being localized “holes” in brightness rather than full axisymmetric structures. Photocenter offsets along the minor axis of the disk in both total intensity and polarized intensity images can be readily explained by the finite thickness of the disk. Alone, polarized scattered light images of disks do not necessarily reveal intrinsic disk structure. However, when combined with total intensity images, the orientation of the disk can be deduced and much can be learned about disk structure and dust properties.","read_count":28,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921939","page":["12"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...12J","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Jang-Condell, Hannah"],"aff":["Department of Physics & Astronomy, University of Wyoming, Laramie, WY 82071, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/12"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:6"],"keyword":["planet─disk interactions","planets and satellites: detection","protoplanetary disks","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe author thanks John Debes for helpful comments in the preparation of this paper, and an anonymous referee, whose feedback greatly improved the paper.

To optimally detect a short-duration signal within a frequency band, we have to precisely compensate for the unknown pulse dispersion, which is a computationally demanding task. We present the “fast dispersion measure transform” algorithm for optimal detection of such signals. Our algorithm has a low theoretical complexity of 2{N}<SUB>f</SUB>{N}<SUB>t</SUB>+{N}<SUB>t</SUB>{N}<SUB>{{∆ </SUB>}}{{log}}<SUB>2</SUB>({N}<SUB>f</SUB>), where N<SUB>f</SUB>, N<SUB>t</SUB>, and N<SUB>∆</SUB> are the numbers of frequency bins, time bins, and dispersion measure bins, respectively. Unlike previously suggested fast algorithms, our algorithm conserves the sensitivity of brute-force dedispersion. Our tests indicate that this algorithm, running on a standard desktop computer and implemented in a high-level programming language, is already faster than the state-of-the-art dedispersion codes running on graphical processing units (GPUs). We also present a variant of the algorithm that can be efficiently implemented on GPUs. The latter algorithm’s computation and data-transport requirements are similar to those of a two-dimensional fast Fourier transform, indicating that incoherent dedispersion can now be considered a nonissue while planning future surveys. We further present a fast algorithm for sensitive detection of pulses shorter than the dispersive smearing limits of incoherent dedispersion. In typical cases, this algorithm is orders of magnitude faster than enumerating dispersion measures and coherently dedispersing by convolution. We analyze the computational complexity of pulsed signal searches by radio interferometers. We conclude that, using our suggested algorithms, maximally sensitive blind searches for dispersed pulses are feasible using existing facilities. We provide an implementation of these algorithms in Python and MATLAB.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922009","page":["11"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835...11Z","identifier":["2017ApJ...835...11Z","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/11","10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/11"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zackay, Barak","Ofek, Eran O."],"aff":["Benoziyo Center for Astrophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, 76100 Rehovot, Israel","Benoziyo Center for Astrophysics, Weizmann Institute of Science, 76100 Rehovot, Israel"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-6786-8774"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/11"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["methods: data analysis","methods: statistical"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the anonymous referee for suggesting the use of convolving filter banks in the hybrid-coherent dedispersion algorithm.

The archetype for the pulsed accretion theory is the eccentric, short-period, classical T Tauri binary DQ Tau. Low-cadence (̃daily) broadband photometry has shown brightening events near most periastron passages, just as numerical simulations would predict for an eccentric binary. Magnetic reconnection events (flares) during the collision of stellar magnetospheres near periastron could, however, produce the same periodic, broadband behavior when observed at a one-day cadence. To reveal the dominant physical mechanism seen in DQ Tau’s low-cadence observations, we have obtained continuous, moderate-cadence, multiband photometry over 10 orbital periods, supplemented with 27 nights of minute-cadence photometry centered on four separate periastron passages. While both accretion and stellar flares are present, the dominant timescale and morphology of brightening events are characteristic of accretion. On average, the mass accretion rate increases by a factor of five near periastron, in good agreement with recent models. Large variability is observed in the morphology and amplitude of accretion events from orbit to orbit. We argue that this is due to the absence of stable circumstellar disks around each star, compounded by inhomogeneities at the inner edge of the CBD and within the accretion streams themselves. Quasiperiodic apastron accretion events are also observed, which are not predicted by binary accretion theory.","read_count":50,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921975","page":["8"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835....8T","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Tofflemire, Benjamin M.","Mathieu, Robert D.","Ardila, David R.","Akeson, Rachel L.","Ciardi, David R.","Johns-Krull, Christopher","Herczeg, Gregory J.","Quijano-Vodniza, Alberto"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin─Madison, 475 North Charter Street, Madison, WI 53706, USA ;","Department of Astronomy, University of Wisconsin─Madison, 475 North Charter Street, Madison, WI 53706, USA ;","The Aerospace Corporation, M2-266, El Segundo, CA 90245, USA","NASA Exoplanet Science Institute, IPAC/Caltech, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA","NASA Exoplanet Science Institute, IPAC/Caltech, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA","Department of Physics and Astronomy, Rice University, Houston, TX 77005, USA","The Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China","University of Nariño Observatory, Pasto, Nariño, Colombia"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-2053-0749","0000-0002-7130-2757","-","-","-","-","0000-0002-7154-6065","-"],"issue":"1","orcid_other":["-","-","-","-","0000-0002-5741-3047","-","-","-"],"volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/8"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["CDS:1","SIMBAD:9"],"keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","binaries: close","stars: individual: DQ Tau","stars: formation","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe authors would like to thank Diego Muñoz and Dong Lai for providing the results of their simulations and for many useful discussions.

The active region produced a medium-size solar flare 1 day before the observations, at ̃18 UT on 2014 December 10, with the post-flare loops still visible at the time of NuSTAR observations. The time evolution of the source emission in the SDO/AIA 335 Å channel reveals the characteristics of an extreme-ultraviolet late-phase event, caused by the continuous formation of new post-flare loops that arch higher and higher in the solar corona. The spectral fitting of NuSTAR observations yields an isothermal source, with temperature 3.8-4.6 MK, emission measure (0.3-1.8) × 10<SUP>46</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, and density estimated at (2.5-6.0) × 10<SUP>8</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The observed AIA fluxes are consistent with the derived NuSTAR temperature range, favoring temperature values in the range of 4.0-4.3 MK. By examining the post-flare loops’ cooling times and energy content, we estimate that at least 12 sets of post-flare loops were formed and subsequently cooled between the onset of the flare and NuSTAR observations, with their total thermal energy content an order of magnitude larger than the energy content at flare peak time. This indicates that the standard approach of using only the flare peak time to derive the total thermal energy content of a flare can lead to a large underestimation of its value.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921912","page":["6"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835....6K","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kuhar, Matej","Krucker, Säm","Hannah, Iain G.","Glesener, Lindsay","Saint-Hilaire, Pascal","Grefenstette, Brian W.","Hudson, Hugh S.","White, Stephen M.","Smith, David M.","Marsh, Andrew J.","Wright, Paul J.","Boggs, Steven E.","Christensen, Finn E.","Craig, William W.","Hailey, Charles J.","Harrison, Fiona A.","Stern, Daniel","Zhang, William W."],"aff":["University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Bahnhofstrasse 6, 5210 Windisch, Switzerland; Institute for Particle Physics, ETH Zürich, 8093 Zürich, Switzerland","University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Bahnhofstrasse 6, 5210 Windisch, Switzerland; Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7450, USA","SUPA School of Physics & Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK","School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Minnesota—Twin Cities, Minneapolis, MN 55455, USA","Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-7450, USA","Cahill Center for Astrophysics, 1216 E.

In recent Hubble Space Telescope imaging of the field, we identify additional multiply lensed galaxies and confirm the sixth quasar image that was identified by Dahle et al. We used the Gemini-North telescope to measure a spectroscopic redshift of z = 4.56 of one of the lensed galaxies. These data are used to refine the lens model of SDSS J2222+2745, compute the time delay and magnifications of the lensed quasar images, and reconstruct the source image of the quasar host and a lensed galaxy at z = 2.3. This galaxy also appears in absorption in our Gemini spectra of the lensed quasar, at a projected distance of 34 kpc. Our model is in agreement with the recent time delay measurements of Dahle et al., who found τ<SUB>AB</SUB> = 47.7 ± 6.0 days and τ<SUB>AC</SUB> = -722 ± 24 days. We use the observed time delays to further constrain the model, and find that the model-predicted time delays of the three faint images of the quasar are τ<SUB>AD</SUB> = 502 ± 68 days, τ<SUB>AE</SUB> = 611 ± 75 days, and τ<SUB>AF</SUB> = 415 ± 72 days. We have initiated a follow-up campaign to measure these time delays with Gemini North. Finally, we present initial results from an X-ray monitoring program with Swift, indicating the presence of hard X-ray emission from the lensed quasar, as well as extended X-ray emission from the cluster itself, which is consistent with the lensing mass measurement and the cluster velocity dispersion.

A previously unrecognized factor governing the spin evolution of such pulsars is the crucial effect of nonsteady or transient accretion. We numerically compute the evolution of accreting neutron stars through a series of outburst and quiescent phases, considering the drastic variation of the accretion rate and the standard disk-magnetosphere interaction. We find that, for the same long-term average accretion rate, X-ray transients can spin up pulsars to rates several times higher than can persistent accretors, even when the spin-down due to electromagnetic radiation during quiescence is included. We also compute an analytical expression for the equilibrium spin frequency in transients, by taking spin equilibrium to mean that no net angular momentum is transferred to the neutron star in each outburst cycle. We find that the equilibrium spin rate for transients, which depends on the peak accretion rate during outbursts, can be much higher than that for persistent sources. This explains our numerical finding. This finding implies that any meaningful study of neutron star spin and magnetic field distributions requires the inclusion of the transient accretion effect, since most accreting neutron star sources are transients. Our finding also implies the existence of a submillisecond pulsar population, which is not observed. This may point to the need for a competing spin-down mechanism for the fastest-rotating accreting pulsars, such as gravitational radiation.","read_count":47,"citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922049","page":["4"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835....4B","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Bhattacharyya, Sudip","Chakrabarty, Deepto"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, 1 Homi Bhabha Road, Colaba, Mumbai 400005, India","Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, 1 Homi Bhabha Road, Colaba, Mumbai 400005, India"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-6351-5808","0000-0001-8804-8946"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/4"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:2"],"keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","methods: analytical","methods: numerical","pulsars: general","stars: rotation","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe authors thank an anonymous referee for constructive comments, which were useful to improve the paper.

Correspondingly, we consider the Galactic distribution of electron density fluctuations consisting of not only a Kolmogorov density spectrum but also a short-wave-dominated density spectrum with the density structure formed at small scales due to shocks. The resulting dependence of the scatter broadening time on the dispersion measure (DM) naturally interprets the existing observational data for both low- and high-DM pulsars. According to the criteria that we derive for a quantitative determination of scattering regimes over wide ranges of DMs and frequencies ν, we find that the pulsars with low DMs are primarily scattered by the Kolmogorov turbulence, while those at low Galactic latitudes with high DMs undergo more enhanced scattering dominated by the supersonic turbulence, where the corresponding density spectrum has a spectral index of ≈ 2.6. Furthermore, by considering a volume filling factor of the density structures with the dependence on ν as \\propto {ν }<SUP>1.4</SUP> in the supersonic turbulence, our model can also explain the observed shallower ν scaling of the scattering time than the Kolmogorov scaling for the pulsars with relatively large DMs. The comparison between our analytical results and the scattering measurements of pulsars in turn makes a useful probe of the properties of the large-scale ISM turbulence, e.g., an injection scale of ̃100 pc, and also characteristics of small-scale density structures.","read_count":68,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921987","page":["2"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835....2X","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Xu, Siyao","Zhang, Bing"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China","Department of Astronomy, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China; Kavli Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China; Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Nevada Las Vegas, NV 89154, USA;"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-9725-2524"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/2"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["ISM: structure","pulsars: general","scattering","turbulence","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments.

The amount of data from the observations will be huge, and hence efficient data compression will be indispensable. Here we propose a low-rank matrix approximation with sparse matrix decomposition as a promising solution to reduce the data size effectively while preserving sufficient scientific information. We apply one of the methods to the movie data obtained with the prototype model of the Tomo-e Gozen mounted on the 1.0 m Schmidt telescope of Kiso Observatory. Once full-scale observation with the Tomo-e Gozen commences, it will generate ̃30 TB of data per night. We demonstrate that the data are compressed by a factor of about 10 in size without losing transient events like optical short transient point sources and meteors. The intensity of point sources can be recovered from the compressed data. The processing runs sufficiently fast, compared with the expected data-acquisition rate in the actual observing runs.","read_count":27,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921972","page":["1"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...835....1M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Morii, Mikio","Ikeda, Shiro","Sako, Shigeyuki","Ohsawa, Ryou"],"aff":["The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, 10-3 Midori-cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 190-8562, Japan","The Institute of Statistical Mathematics, 10-3 Midori-cho, Tachikawa, Tokyo 190-8562, Japan","Institute of Astronomy, The University of Tokyo, 2-21-1 Ohsawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0015, Japan","Institute of Astronomy, The University of Tokyo, 2-21-1 Ohsawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0015, Japan"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","0000-0001-5797-6010"],"issue":"1","volume":"835","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/835/1/1"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["methods: data analysis","techniques: miscellaneous","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis research is supported by CREST and PRESTO, the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), and in part by JSPS Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (KAKENHI) Grant Nos.

By means of a proton radiography technique, the evolution of the instability is temporally and spatially resolved on a timescale much shorter than the hydrodynamic one. The density of the thin shell exceeds that of the surrounding plasma, which lets electrons diffuse outward. An ambipolar electric field grows on both sides of the thin shell that is antiparallel to the density gradient. Ripples in the thin shell result in a spatially varying balance between the thermal pressure force mediated by this field and the ram pressure force that is exerted on it by the inflowing plasma. This mismatch amplifies the ripples by the same mechanism that drives the hydrodynamic nonlinear thin-shell instability (NTSI). Our results thus constitute the first experimental verification that the NTSI can develop in colliding flows.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921968","page":["L21"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834L..21A","identifier":["2017ApJ...834L..21A","10.3847/2041-8213/834/2/L21","10.3847/2041-8213/834/2/L21"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Ahmed, H.","Doria, D.","Dieckmann, M.

When the star survives disruption, we find its magnetic field amplifies by a factor of up to 20, but see no evidence for a self-sustaining dynamo that would yield arbitrary field growth. For stars that do not survive, and within the tidal debris streams produced in partial disruptions, we find that the component of the magnetic field parallel to the direction of stretching along the debris stream only decreases slightly with time, eventually resulting in a stream where the magnetic pressure is in equipartition with the gas.

Both the trailing edge and the leading edge of the EUV wave front in the north direction are reliably traced, revealing generally compatible propagation velocities in both perspectives and a velocity ratio of about 1/3. When the wave front encounters a coronal cavity near the northern polar coronal hole, the trailing edge of the front stops while its leading edge just shows a small gap and extends over the cavity, meanwhile getting significantly decelerated but intensified. We propose that the trailing edge and the leading edge of the northward propagating wave front correspond to a non-wave coronal mass ejection component and a fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic wave component, respectively. The interaction of the fast-mode wave and the coronal cavity may involve a mode conversion process, through which part of the fast-mode wave is converted to a slow-mode wave that is trapped along the magnetic field lines. This scenario can reasonably account for the unusual behavior of the wave front over the coronal cavity.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922035","page":["L15"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834L..15Z","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zong, Weiguo","Dai, Yu"],"aff":["Key Laboratory of Space Weather, National Center for Space Weather, China Meteorological Administration, Beijing 100081, China; Key Laboratory of Modern Astronomy and Astrophysics (Nanjing University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing 210023, China;","Key Laboratory of Modern Astronomy and Astrophysics (Nanjing University), Ministry of Education, Nanjing 210023, China; School of Astronomy and Space Science, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210023, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0001-9856-2770"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/2041-8213/834/2/L15"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: coronal mass ejections: CMEs","Sun: flares","waves","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe are grateful of the anonymous referee for suggestive comments.

In addition, we used a functional relationship to account for the completeness of the SMASH field sample analyzed that takes into account not only the number of fields used but also their particular spatial distribution; the present sample statistically represents ̃50% of the whole SMASH survey. The relative small number of new stellar cluster candidates identified, most of them distributed in the outer regions of the MCs, might suggest that the lack of detection of a larger number of new cluster candidates beyond the main bodies of the MCs could likely be the outcome once the survey is completed.","read_count":16,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922019","page":["L14"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834L..14P","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Piatti, Andrés E."],"aff":["Consejo Nacional de Investigaciones Científicas y Técnicas, Av.

However, these generally have relied on using a single photon in the highest energy range. Furthermore, the search for LIV lags has been hindered by our ignorance concerning the intrinsic time lag in different energy bands. GRB 160625B, the only burst so far with a well-defined transition from positive lags to negative lags provides a unique opportunity to put new constraints on LIV. Using multi-photon energy bands we consider the contributions to the observed spectral lag from both the intrinsic time lag and the lag by LIV effects, and assuming the intrinsic time lag to have a positive dependence on the photon energy, we obtain robust limits on LIV by directly fitting the spectral lag data of GRB 160625B. Here we show that these robust limits on the quantum gravity energy scales are {E}<SUB>{QG</SUB>,1}≥slant 0.5× {10}<SUP>16</SUP> GeV for the linear, and {E}<SUB>{QG</SUB>,2}≥slant 1.4× {10}<SUP>7</SUP> GeV for the quadratic LIV effects, respectively.

The outer disk is revealed in reprocessed archival Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS-F110W images, as well as new coronagraphic H-band images from the Very Large Telescope SPHERE instrument. The disk extends from 1.″1 (65 au) to 4.″6 (250 au) and is seen at an inclination of 73°, which refines previous measurements at lower angular resolution. We also report no companion detection larger than 3 M<SUB>Jup</SUB> at projected separations beyond 20 au from the star (0.″34). Comparison between the F110W and H-band images is consistent with a gray color of 49 Ceti’s dust, indicating grains larger than ≳2 μm. Our photometric measurements indicate a scattering efficiency/infrared excess ratio of 0.2-0.4, relatively low compared to other characterized debris disks. We find that 49 Ceti presents morphological and scattering properties very similar to the gas-rich HD 131835 system. From our constraint on the disk inclination we find that the atomic gas previously detected in absorption must extend to the inner disk, and that the latter must be depleted of CO gas. Building on previous studies, we propose a schematic view of the system describing the dust and gas structure around 49 Ceti and hypothetical scenarios for the gas nature and origin.","citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922000","page":["L12"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834L..12C","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Choquet, Élodie","Milli, Julien","Wahhaj, Zahed","Soummer, Rémi","Roberge, Aki","Augereau, Jean-Charles","Booth, Mark","Absil, Olivier","Boccaletti, Anthony","Chen, Christine H.","Debes, John H.","del Burgo, Carlos","Dent, William R.

Observed H-band sizes are measured from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/F160W imaging. Distributions of individual galaxy masses and sizes illustrate that a clear mass-size relation exists up to z ̃ 7. At z ̃ 7, we find that the average galaxy size from the mass-size relation is more compact at a fixed mass of log(M<SUB>*</SUB>/M<SUB>☉</SUB>) = 10.1, with {r}<SUB>1/2,{maj</SUB>}=1.02+/- 0.29 kpc, than at lower redshifts. This is consistent with our results from stacking the same CANDELS HST/F160W imaging, when we correct for galaxy position angle alignment. We find that the size evolution of star-forming galaxies is well fit by a power law of the form {r}<SUB>e</SUB>=7.07{(1+z)}<SUP>-0.89</SUP> kpc, which is consistent with previous works for normal star-formers at 1 < z < 4. In order to compare our slope with those derived Lyman break galaxy studies, we correct for different IMFs and methodology and find a slope of -0.97 ± 0.02, which is shallower than that reported for the evolution of Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at z > 4 ({r}<SUB>e</SUB>\\propto {(1+z)}<SUP>-1.2+/- 0.06</SUP>).

The He-shell flashes result in the expansion and, ultimately, ejection of the accreted and then I-process enriched material, via super-Eddington-luminosity winds or Roche-lobe overflow. The WD models do not retain any significant amount of the accreted mass, with a He retention efficiency of ≲ 10 % depending on mass and convective boundary mixing assumptions.

Carbon burning includes a weak reaction that removes electrons, resulting in a lower electron-to-baryon ratio ({Y}<SUB>{{e</SUB>}}) in the regions processed by carbon burning compared to the unburned C/O core, making the O/Ne mantle denser than the C/O core as the WD cools.

Recently, the sub-arcsecond localization (̃100 mas precision) of FRB 121102 using the Very Large Array has led to its unambiguous association with persistent radio and optical counterparts, and to the identification of its host galaxy. However, an even more precise localization is needed in order to probe the direct physical relationship between the millisecond bursts themselves and the associated persistent emission. Here, we report very-long-baseline radio interferometric observations using the European VLBI Network and the 305 m Arecibo telescope, which simultaneously detect both the bursts and the persistent radio emission at milliarcsecond angular scales and show that they are co-located to within a projected linear separation of ≲40 pc (≲12 mas angular separation, at 95% confidence). We detect consistent angular broadening of the bursts and persistent radio source (̃2-4 mas at 1.7 GHz), which are both similar to the expected Milky Way scattering contribution. The persistent radio source has a projected size constrained to be ≲ 0.7 pc (≲0.2 mas angular extent at 5.0 GHz) and a lower limit for the brightness temperature of {T}<SUB>b</SUB>≳ 5× {10}<SUP>7</SUP> {{K}}. Together, these observations provide strong evidence for a direct physical link between FRB 121102 and the compact persistent radio source. We argue that a burst source associated with a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus or a young neutron star energizing a supernova remnant are the two scenarios for FRB 121102 that best match the observed data.","citation_count":62,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922017","page":["L8"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834L...8M","bibgroup":["NRAO","Leiden Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Marcote, B.","Paragi, Z.","Hessels, J.

The net DM contribution of the host galaxy to FRB 121102 is likely to be lower than this value depending on geometrical factors. We show that the persistent radio source at FRB 121102’s location reported by Marcote et al. is offset from the galaxy’s center of light by ̃200 mas and the host galaxy does not show optical signatures for AGN activity. If FRB 121102 is typical of the wider FRB population and if future interferometric localizations preferentially find them in dwarf galaxies with low metallicities and prominent emission lines, they would share such a preference with long gamma-ray bursts and superluminous supernovae.","citation_count":87,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922032","page":["L7"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834L...7T","bibgroup":["NRAO","Leiden Observatory","Gemini"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Tendulkar, S.

However, only one, iPTF16geu, has been found to date, and many more are needed to achieve these goals. To increase the multiply imaged SN Ia discovery rate, we present a simple algorithm for identifying gravitationally lensed SN Ia candidates in cadenced, wide-field optical imaging surveys. The technique is to look for supernovae that appear to be hosted by elliptical galaxies, but that have absolute magnitudes implied by the apparent hosts’ photometric redshifts that are far brighter than the absolute magnitudes of normal SNe Ia (the brightest type of supernovae found in elliptical galaxies). Importantly, this purely photometric method does not require the ability to resolve the lensed images for discovery. Active galactic nuclei, the primary sources of contamination that affect the method, can be controlled using catalog cross-matches and color cuts. Highly magnified core-collapse SNe will also be discovered as a byproduct of the method. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, we forecast that the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope can discover up to 500 multiply imaged SNe Ia using this technique in a 10 year z-band search, more than an order of magnitude improvement over previous estimates.

In this Letter, we report on the initial disappearance of the pulsed emission and its prompt reactivation and dramatic evolution over several months of observation. The periodic pulse profile at S-band (2.3 GHz) after reactivation exhibits a multi-component emission structure, while the simultaneous X-band (8.4 GHz) profile shows a single emission peak. Single pulses were also detected at S-band near the main emission peaks. We present measurements of the spectral index across a wide frequency bandwidth, which captures the underlying changes in the radio emission profile of the neutron star. The high-frequency radio detection, unusual emission profile, and observed variability suggest similarities with magnetars, which may independently link the high-energy outbursts to magnetar-like behavior.","read_count":52,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921946","page":["L2"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834L...2M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Majid, Walid A.","Pearlman, Aaron B.","Dobreva, Tatyana","Horiuchi, Shinji","Kocz, Jonathon","Lippuner, Jonas","Prince, Thomas A."],"aff":["Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA;  Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA;  Division of Physics, Mathematics, and Astronomy, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA","CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, Canberra Deep Space Communications Complex, P.O.

Our spectroscopic analysis yields redshifts for 52 gravitational arcs present in the core of our galaxy clusters, which correspond to 35 distinct background sources that are clearly distorted by the gravitational potential of these clusters. These lensed galaxies span a wide redshift range of 0.8 ≤ z ≤ 2.9, with a median redshift of z<SUB>s</SUB> = 1.8 ± 0.1. We also measure reliable redshifts for 1004 cluster members, allowing us to obtain robust velocity dispersion measurements for 23 of these clusters, which we then use to determine their dynamical masses by using a simulation-based σ<SUB>DM</SUB> - M<SUB>200</SUB> scaling relation.

We analyze and quantify some possible effects that might bias our mass estimates, such as the presence of substructure, the region where cluster members are selected for spectroscopic follow-up, the final number of confirmed members, and line-of-sight effects. We find that 10 clusters of our sample with N<SUB>mem</SUB> ≳ 20 show signs of dynamical substructure. However, the velocity data of only one system is inconsistent with a uni-modal distribution. We therefore assume that the substructures are only marginal and not of comparable size to the clusters themselves. Consequently, our velocity dispersion and mass estimates can be used as priors for SL mass reconstruction studies and also represent an important step toward a better understanding of the properties of the SL galaxy cluster population.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921981","page":["210"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..210C","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes","CFHT"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Carrasco, Mauricio","Barrientos, L.

Despite their importance, a detailed understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for the driving of these winds is lacking. In an effort to gain more insight into the nature of these flows, we perform global three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of an isolated Milky Way-size starburst galaxy. We focus on the dynamical role of cosmic rays (CRs) injected by supernovae, and specifically on the impact of the streaming and anisotropic diffusion of CRs along the magnetic fields. We find that these microphysical effects can have a significant effect on the wind launching and mass loading factors, depending on the details of the plasma physics. Due to the CR streaming instability, CRs propagating in the interstellar medium scatter on self-excited Alfvén waves and couple to the gas. When the wave growth due to the streaming instability is inhibited by some damping process, such as turbulent damping, the coupling of CRs to the gas is weaker and their effective propagation speed faster than the Alfvén speed. Alternatively, CRs could scatter from “extrinsic turbulence” that is driven by another mechanism. We demonstrate that the presence of moderately super-Alfvénic CR streaming enhances the efficiency of galactic wind driving. Cosmic rays stream away from denser regions near the galactic disk along partially ordered magnetic fields and in the process accelerate more tenuous gas away from the galaxy. For CR acceleration efficiencies broadly consistent with the observational constraints, CRs reduce the galactic star formation rates and significantly aid in launching galactic winds.","read_count":74,"citation_count":23,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922008","page":["208"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..208R","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Ruszkowski, Mateusz","Yang, H. -Y.

We also conduct a comprehensive study of the populations in this complex structure. Spectral results indicate the average cluster and cluster red sequence galaxies experienced no enhanced star formation relative to the surrounding field during the merger, ruling out a predominantly merger-quenched population. We find that the average blue galaxy in the North cluster is currently active, and that the South cluster is currently post-starburst, having undergone a recent star formation event. Although the North activity could be latent or long-term merger effects, a young blue stellar population and irregular geometry suggest the cluster was still forming prior the collision. Even though the South activity coincides with the time of the merger, the blue early-type population could be a result of secular cluster processes. The evidence suggests that the dearth or surfeit of activity is indiscernible from normal cluster galaxy evolution.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921913","page":["205"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..205M","bibgroup":["Keck","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mansheim, A.

Our sample consists of 17,432 quasars selected from the SDSS Data Release 7 with a redshift range of 0.72 < z < 1.63. A strong anticorrelation between the Mg II equivalent width (EW) and the Eddington ratio is found, while only a weak positive correlation is found between the Fe II EW and the Eddington ratio. To investigate the origin of these differing behaviors of Mg II and Fe II emission lines, we perform photoionization calculations using the Cloudy code, where constraints from recent reverberation mapping studies are considered. We find from calculations that (1) Mg II and Fe II emission lines are created at different regions in a photoionized cloud, and (2) their EW correlations with the Eddington ratio can be explained by just changing the cloud gas density. These results indicate that the Mg II/Fe II flux ratio, which has been used as a first-order proxy for the Mg/Fe abundance ratio in chemical evolution studies with quasar emission lines, depends largely on the cloud gas density. By correcting this density dependence, we propose new diagnostics of the Mg/Fe abundance ratio for a broad-line region cloud. In comparing the derived Mg/Fe abundance ratios with chemical evolution models, we suggest that α-enrichment by mass loss from metal-poor intermediate-mass stars occurred at z ̃ 2 or earlier.","read_count":26,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922036","page":["203"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..203S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Sameshima, H.","Yoshii, Y.","Kawara, K."],"aff":["Laboratory of Infrared High-resolution Spectroscopy, Koyama Astronomical Observatory, Kyoto Sangyo University, Motoyama, Kamigamo, Kita-ku, Kyoto 603-8555, Japan","Institute of Astronomy, School of Science, University of Tokyo, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0015, Japan","Institute of Astronomy, School of Science, University of Tokyo, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0015, Japan;"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/203"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:5"],"keyword":["galaxies: abundances","galaxies: active","quasars: emission lines","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe acknowledge the anonymous referee for constructive comments that helped improve the quality of our manuscript.

A homogeneous, straight cylinder below a critical line mass is marginally stable. However, if the cylinder is bent, such as with a slight sinusoidal perturbation, an otherwise stable configuration starts to oscillate, is triggered into fragmentation, and collapses. This previously unstudied behavior allows a filament to fragment at any given scale, as long as it has slight bends. We call this process “geometrical fragmentation.” In our realization, the spacing between the cores matches the wavelength of the sinusoidal perturbation, whereas up to now, filaments were thought to be only fragmenting on the characteristic scale set by the mass-to-line ratio.

In order to discriminate between different star formation models, we analyze 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of low-mass cores and explore the correlation between magnetic field orientation and outflow orientation over time.

Cumulative distribution functions of the projected angle between the magnetic field and outflow show different degrees of alignment in simulations with differing mass-to-flux ratios. The distribution function for the less magnetized core agrees with observations finding random alignment between outflow and field orientations, while the more magnetized core exhibits stronger alignment. We find that fractional polarization increases when the system is viewed such that the magnetic field is close to the plane of the sky, and the values of fractional polarization are consistent with observational measurements. The simulation outflow, which reflects the underlying angular momentum of the accreted gas, changes direction significantly over over the first ̃0.1 Myr of evolution. This movement could lead to the observed random alignment between outflows and the magnetic fields in protostellar cores.","citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921984","page":["201"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..201L","bibgroup":["NRAO","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Lee, Joyce W.

In order to obtain unbiased measurements of its spin and the related relativistic effects, a comprehensive understanding of the gravitational perturbations of the stars and stellar remnants around the MBH is quite essential. Here, we study the perturbations on the observables of a typical target star, I.e., the apparent orbital motion and the redshift, due to both the spin-induced relativistic effects and the Newtonian attractions of a single object or a cluster of disturbing objects. We find that, in most cases, the Newtonian perturbations on the observables are mainly attributed to the perturbed orbital period of the target star rather than the Newtonian orbital precessions. Looking at the currently detected star S2/S0-2, we find that its spin-induced effects are very likely obscured by the gravitational perturbations from the star S0-102 alone. We also investigate and discuss the Newtonian perturbations on a hypothetical S-star located inside the orbits of those currently detected. By considering a number of possible stellar distributions near the central MBH, we find that the spin-induced effects on the apparent position and redshift dominate over the stellar perturbations for target stars with orbital semimajor axis smaller than 100-400 au if the MBH is maximally spinning. Our results suggest that, in principle, the stellar perturbations can be removed because they have morphologies distinct from those of the relativistic Kerr-type signatures.","read_count":21,"citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921995","page":["198"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..198Z","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zhang, Fupeng","Iorio, Lorenzo"],"aff":["School of Physics and Astronomy, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510275, China","Ministero dell’ Istruzione, dell’ Università e della Ricerca (M.I.U.R.)-Istruzione, Viale Unità di Italia 68, I-70125 Bari (BA), Italy;;"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-0403-9522","0000-0003-4949-2694"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/198"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:4"],"keyword":["black hole physics","Galaxy: center","Galaxy: nucleus","gravitation","relativistic processes","stars: kinematics and dynamics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank Lu Youjun, Yu Qingjuan, and Yang Yi-Jung for helpful suggestions.

Published Voyager 1 magnetometer and plasma wave data provide strong evidence for the coupled magnetic amplification (≈ 30 % ) and density depletion (≈ 50 % ) expected for a weak PDL. The predicted reduction in parallel temperature is ≈ 50 % . The locations on the sky of the PDL and the points on the heliopause of maximum magnetic draping and total pressure are predicted using the ISM magnetic field direction obtained from the Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX) ribbon. The IBEX ribbon overlies the former, as expected, while the latter lies within the ridge of maximum, non-ribbon, globally distributed flux. The PDL should be strongest along the ISM field line passing through these points and the Sun-ISM velocity vector. Based on their trajectories, Voyager 2 and New Horizons should observe a much stronger PDL (stronger magnetic amplification, density depletion, and changes in temperature) than Voyager 1. Finally, the reduced cosmic ray fluxes observed near 90° pitchangle by Voyager 1 beyond the heliopause appear qualitatively consistent with wave-particle interactions transferring perpendicular particle energy to parallel energy where the PDL is strong, followed by magnetic focusing as particles propagate into weaker magnetic field regions.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921976","page":["197"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..197C","identifier":["2017ApJ...834..197C","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/197","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/197"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Cairns, Iver H.","Fuselier, S.

Here, the overall Galactic nova rate is estimated by extrapolating the observed rate for novae reaching m≤slant 2 to include the entire Galaxy using a two component disk plus bulge model for the distribution of stars in the Milky Way. The present analysis improves on previous work by considering important corrections for incompleteness in the observed rate of bright novae and by employing a Monte Carlo analysis to better estimate the uncertainty in the derived nova rates. Several models are considered to account for differences in the assumed properties of bulge and disk nova populations and in the absolute magnitude distribution. The simplest models, which assume uniform properties between bulge and disk novae, predict Galactic nova rates of ̃50 to in excess of 100 per year, depending on the assumed incompleteness at bright magnitudes. Models where the disk novae are assumed to be more luminous than bulge novae are explored, and predict nova rates up to 30% lower, in the range of ̃35 to ̃75 per year. An average of the most plausible models yields a rate of {50}<SUB>-23</SUB><SUP>+31</SUP> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is arguably the best estimate currently available for the nova rate in the Galaxy.

There are many close connections between a central SMBH and its host galaxy because the former plays very important roles on galaxy formation and evolution. For this reason, the evolution of SMBHBs in merging galaxies is a fundamental challenge. Since there are many discussions about SMBHB evolution in a gas-rich environment, we focus on the quiescent galaxy, using tidal disruption (TD) as a diagnostic tool. Our study is based on a series of numerical, large particle number, direct N-body simulations for dry major mergers. According to the simulation results, the evolution can be divided into three phases. In phase I, the TD rate for two well separated SMBHs in a merging system is similar to that for a single SMBH in an isolated galaxy. After two SMBHs approach close enough to form a bound binary in phase II, the disruption rate can be enhanced by ̃2 orders of magnitude within a short time. This “boosted” disruption stage finishes after the SMBHB evolves to a compact binary system in phase III, corresponding to a reduction in disruption rate back to a level of a few times higher than in phase I. We also discuss how to correctly extrapolate our N-body simulation results to reality, and the implications of our results to observations.","read_count":31,"citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921955","page":["195"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..195L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Li, Shuo","Liu, F.

The displacements due to the acceleration term make a high contribution {{{Ω }}}<SUB>λ </SUB> to the energy density of the universe, satisfying an equation of the form {{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{m</SUB>}}+{{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{k</SUB>}}+{{{Ω }}}<SUB>λ </SUB>=1. The models do not demand the existence of unknown particles. There is a family of flat models with different density parameters {{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{m</SUB>}}< 1. Numerical integrations of the cosmological equations for different values of the curvature and density parameter k and {{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{m</SUB>}} are performed. The presence of even tiny amounts of matter in the universe tends to kill scale invariance. The point is that for {{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{m</SUB>}}=0.3 the effect is not yet completely killed. Models with non-zero density start explosively with a braking phase followed by a continuously accelerating expansion. Several observational properties are examined, in particular the distances, the m-z diagram, and the {{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{m</SUB>}} versus {{{Ω }}}<SUB>λ </SUB> plot. Comparisons with observations are also performed for the Hubble constant H<SUB>0</SUB> versus {{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{m</SUB>}}, for the expansion history in the plot H(z)/(z+1) versus redshift z, and for the transition redshift from braking to acceleration. These first dynamical tests are satisfied by scale-invariant models, which thus deserve further study.","read_count":2635,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922028","page":["194"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..194M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Maeder, Andre"],"aff":["Geneva Observatory, University of Geneva CH-1290 Sauverny, Switzerland"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/194"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["cosmology: theory","dark energy","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nI want to express my best thanks to D.

This work is devoted to using a function to describe the shape of sunspot cycles, including bimodal cycles, and we find that the shape of sunspot cycles can be described by a binary mixture of Gaussian functions with six parameters, two amplitudes, two gradients of curve, and two rising times, and the parameters could be reduced to three. The fitting result of this binary mixture of Gaussian functions is compared with some other functions used previously in the literature, and this function works pretty well, especially at cycle peaks. It is worth mentioning that the function can describe well the shape of those sunspot cycles that show double peaks, and it is superior to the binary mixture of the Laplace functions that was once utilized. The Solar Influences Data Analysis Center, on behalf of the World Data Center, recently issued a new version (version 2) of sunspot number.

We use five lines of sight inside the northern Fermi Bubble to constrain the velocity and column densities of outflowing gas traced by O I, Al II, C II, C IV, Si II, Si III, Si IV, and other species. We find that all five lines of sight inside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high velocity absorption components, whereas only 9 out of the 42 lines of sight outside the northern Fermi Bubble exhibit blueshifted high velocity absorption components.

Orbiting a nearby M2.5 dwarf and receiving virtually the same stellar insolation as Earth, K2-18b would be a prime candidate for the first detailed atmospheric characterization of a habitable-zone exoplanet using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST)and James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Here, we report the detection of a third transit of K2-18b near the predicted transit time using the Spitzer Space Telescope. The Spitzer detection demonstrates the periodic nature of the two transit events discovered by K2, confirming that K2-18 is indeed orbited by a super-Earth in a 33 day orbit, ruling out the alternative scenario of two similarly sized, long-period planets transiting only once within the 75 day Kepler Space Telescope (K2) observation. We also find, however, that the transit event detected by Spitzer occurred 1.85 hr (7σ ) before the predicted transit time. Our joint analysis of the Spitzer and K2 photometry reveals that this early occurrence of the transit is not caused by transit timing variations, but the result of an inaccurate ephemeris due to a previously undetected data anomaly in the K2 photometry.

We concentrate on the dust properties of the oxygen-rich evolved stars. The dust composition has smaller contributions from alumina compared to the Galaxy. This difference may arise from the lower metallicity in the SMC, but it could be a selection effect, as the SMC sample includes more stars that are brighter and thus more massive. The distribution of the SMC stars along the silicate sequence looks more like the Galactic sample of red supergiants than asymptotic giant branch stars (AGBs). While many of the SMC stars are definitively on the AGB, several also show evidence of hot bottom burning. Three of the supergiants show PAH emission at 11.3 μm. Two other sources show mixed chemistry, with both carbon-rich and oxygen-rich spectral features. One, MSX SMC 134, may be the first confirmed silicate/carbon star in the SMC. The other, MSX SMC 049, is a candidate post-AGB star. MSX SMC 145, previously considered a candidate OH/IR star, is actually an AGB star with a background galaxy at z = 0.16 along the same line of sight. We consider the overall characteristics of all the MSX sources, the most infrared-bright objects in the SMC, in light of the higher sensitivity and resolution of Spitzer, and compare them with the object types expected from the original selection criteria. This population represents what will be seen in more distant galaxies by the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Color-color diagrams generated from the IRS spectra and the mid-infrared filters on JWST show how one can separate evolved stars from young stellar objects (YSOs) and distinguish among different classes of YSOs.","citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922048","page":["185"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..185K","bibgroup":["Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kraemer, K.

Such a chemical inhomogeneity reveals the external origin of the metal-poor gas fueling star formation, possibly indicating accretion from the cosmic web. This paper studies the kinematic properties of the ionized gas in these galaxies. Most XMPs have a rotation velocity around a few tens of km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The star-forming regions appear to move coherently. The velocity is constant within each region, and the velocity dispersion sometimes increases within the star-forming clump toward the galaxy midpoint, suggesting inspiral motion toward the galaxy center. Other regions present a local maximum in velocity dispersion at their center, suggesting a moderate global expansion. The Hα line wings show a number of faint emission features with amplitudes around a few per cent of the main Hα component, and wavelength shifts between 100 and 400 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The components are often paired, so that red and blue emission features with similar amplitudes and shifts appear simultaneously. Assuming the faint emission to be produced by expanding shell-like structures, the inferred mass loading factor (mass loss rate divided by star formation rate) exceeds 10. Since the expansion velocity far exceeds the rotational and turbulent velocities, the gas may eventually escape from the galaxy disk. The observed motions involve energies consistent with the kinetic energy released by individual core-collapse supernovae.

However, this decay rate is significantly slowed when the nuclei are fully ionized because K-shell electrons are unavailable for capture. In this paper, we explore the effect of these delayed decays on white dwarfs (WDs) that may survive Type Ia and Type Iax supernovae (SNe Ia and SNe Iax). The energy released by the delayed radioactive decays of {}<SUP>56</SUP>{Ni} and {}<SUP>56</SUP>{Co} drives a persistent wind from the surviving WD’s surface that contributes to the late-time appearance of these SNe after emission from the bulk of the SN ejecta has faded. We use the stellar evolution code MESA to calculate the hydrodynamic evolution and resulting light curves of these winds. Our post-SN Ia models conflict with late-time observations of SN 2011fe, but uncertainties in our initial conditions prevent us from ruling out the existence of surviving WD donors. Much better agreement with observations is achieved with our models of post-SN Iax bound remnants, providing evidence that these explosions are due to deflagrations in accreting WDs that fail to completely unbind the WDs. Future radiative transfer calculations and wind models utilizing simulations of explosions for more accurate initial conditions will extend our study of radioactively powered winds from post-SN surviving WDs and enable their use as powerful discriminants among the various SN Ia and SN Iax progenitor scenarios.","read_count":49,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921927","page":["180"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..180S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Shen, Ken J.","Schwab, Josiah"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Astrophysics Center, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA","Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA;"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-4870-8855"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/180"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:7"],"keyword":["binaries: close","nuclear reactions","nucleosynthesis","abundances","supernovae: general","white dwarfs","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank Lars Bildsten, Ryan Foley, Claes Fransson, Dan Kasen, Wolfgang Kerzendorf, Alison Miller, Rüdiger Pakmor, Eliot Quataert, and Stuart Sim for helpful discussions, and Lin-Manuel Miranda and Leslie Odom, Jr., for inspiring the title.

The Si IV detection indicates an enriched, disk-wide, ionized gas inflow toward the disk. This inflow is most likely multi-phase as the redshifted components can also be observed in ions with lower ionization states (e.g., S II, P II, Fe II, Si II).

We achieve our astrometric alignment by solving first for the ionospheric (dispersive) contributions using wide-band centimeter-wavelength observations. Second, we solve for the tropospheric (non-dispersive) contributions by using fast frequency-switching at the target millimeter-wavelengths. These solutions can be scaled and transferred from low frequency to the high frequency. To complete the calibration chain an additional step is required to remove a residual constant phase offset on each antenna. The result is an astrometric calibration and the measurement of the core-shift between 22 and 43 GHz for the jet in BL Lacertae to be -8 ± 5, 20 ± 6 μas, in R.A. and decl., respectively. By comparison to conventional phase referencing at centimeter-wavelengths we are able to show that this core shift at millimeter-wavelengths is significantly less than what would be predicted by extrapolating the low-frequency result, which closely followed the predictions of the Blandford & Königl conical jet model. As such it would be the first demonstration for the association of the VLBI core with a recollimation shock, normally hidden at low frequencies due to the optical depth, which could be responsible for the γ-ray production in blazar jets.","citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922038","page":["177"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..177D","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Dodson, Richard","Rioja, María J.","Molina, Sol N.","Gómez, José L."],"aff":["International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, M468, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia","International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research, M468, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Hwy, Crawley, Western Australia 6009, Australia; CSIRO Astronomy and Space Science, 26 Dick Perry Avenue, Kensington WA 6151, Australia; Observatorio Astronómico Nacional (IGN), Alfonso XII, 3 y 5, E-28014 Madrid, Spain","Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía-CSIC, Glorieta de la Astronomía s/n, E-18008 Granada, Spain","Instituto de Astrofísica de Andalucía-CSIC, Glorieta de la Astronomía s/n, E-18008 Granada, Spain"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-0392-3604","0000-0003-4871-9535","-","0000-0003-4190-7613"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/177"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:11"],"keyword":["astrometry","quasars: individual: BL-Lac","radio continuum: galaxies","techniques: interferometric","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe would like to especially acknowledge the numerous conversations with Richard Porcas about the best approaches for the analysis, and the referee for comments that improved the paper.

The coronagraph manipulates the phase in the pupil to produce three beams yielding two coronagraphic point-spread functions (PSFs) and one faint leakage PSF. The phase pattern is imposed through the inherently achromatic geometric phase, enabled by liquid crystal technology and polarization techniques. The coronagraphic optic is manufactured using a direct-write technique for precise control of the liquid crystal pattern and multitwist retarders for achromatization. By integrating a linear phase ramp to the coronagraphic phase pattern, two separated coronagraphic PSFs are created with a single pupil-plane optic, which makes it robust and easy to install in existing telescopes. The two coronagraphic PSFs contain a 180° dark hole on each side of a star, and these complementary copies of the star are used to correct the seeing halo close to the star. To characterize the coronagraph, we collected a data set of a bright (m<SUB>L</SUB> = 0-1) nearby star with ̃1.5 hr of observing time. By rotating and optimally scaling one PSF and subtracting it from the other PSF, we see a contrast improvement by 1.46 magnitudes at 3.5 λ /D. With regular angular differential imaging at 3.9 μm, the MagAO vector apodizing phase plate coronagraph delivers a 5σ {{∆ }}{mag} contrast of 8.3 (={10}<SUP>-3.3</SUP>) at 2 λ /D and 12.2 (={10}<SUP>-4.8</SUP>) at 3.5 λ /D.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921942","page":["175"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..175O","bibgroup":["Leiden Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Otten, Gilles P.

The planetary nebulae luminosity function (PNLF) is one of very few techniques that can provide distance estimates to within ̃10% however, it requires a planetary nebula (PN) sample that is uncontaminated by other ionizing sources. We employ optical integral field unit spectroscopy using the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer on the Very Large Telescope to measure [O III] line fluxes for sources unresolved on 50 pc scales within the central star-forming galaxy disk of NGC 628. We use diagnostic line ratios to identify 62 PNe, 30 supernova remnants, and 87 H II regions within our fields. Using the 36 brightest PNe, we determine a new PNLF distance modulus of {29.91}<SUB>-0.13</SUB><SUP>+0.08</SUP> mag (9.59{}<SUB>-0.57</SUB><SUP>+0.35</SUP> Mpc), which is in good agreement with literature values, but significantly larger than the previously reported PNLF distance. We are able to explain the discrepancy and recover the previous result when we reintroduce SNR contaminants to our sample. This demonstrates the power of full spectral information over narrowband imaging in isolating PNe. Given our limited spatial coverage within the Galaxy, we show that this technique can be used to refine distance estimates, even when IFU observations cover only a fraction of a galaxy disk.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922021","page":["174"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..174K","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kreckel, K.","Groves, B.","Bigiel, F.","Blanc, G.

A test result with CMEs launched with different Carrington rotation magnetograms is shown.

Coupling AWSoM to an inner heliosphere model with the Space Weather Modeling Framework extends the total domain beyond the orbit of Earth. Physical processes included in the model are multi-species thermodynamics, electron heat conduction (both collisional and collisionless formulations), optically thin radiative cooling, and Alfvén-wave turbulence that accelerates and heats the solar wind. The Alfvén-wave description is physically self-consistent, including non-Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin reflection and physics-based apportioning of turbulent dissipative heating to both electrons and protons. Within this model, we initiate the CME by using the Gibson-Low analytical flux rope model and follow its evolution for days, in which time it propagates beyond STEREO A. A detailed comparison study is performed using remote as well as in situ observations. Although the flux rope structure is not compared directly due to lack of relevant ejecta observation at 1 au in this event, our results show that the new model can reproduce many of the observed features near the Sun (e.g., CME-driven extreme ultraviolet [EUV] waves, deflection of the flux rope from the coronal hole, “double-front” in the white light images) and in the heliosphere (e.g., shock propagation direction, shock properties at STEREO A).","citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921910","page":["172"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..172J","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Jin, M.","Manchester, W.

For this reason, under the assumption of a thermal steady state, it may be used to infer the heating rate and, in turn, the star formation rate (SFR) in local as well as in high redshift systems. In this work, radio and ultraviolet observations of the Galactic ISM are used to understand whether C II is indeed a good tracer of the SFR. For a sample of high Galactic latitude sightlines, direct measurements of the temperature indicate the presence of C II in both the cold and the warm phases of the diffuse interstellar gas. The cold gas fraction (̃10%-50% of the total neutral gas column density) is not negligible even at high Galactic latitude. It is shown that to correctly estimate the SFR, C II cooling in both phases should hence be considered. The simple assumption, that the [C II] line originates only from either the cold or the warm phase, significantly underpredicts or overpredicts the SFR, respectively. These results are particularly important in the context of Damped Lyα systems for which a similar method is often used to estimate the SFR. The derived SFRs in such cases may not be reliable if the temperature of the gas under consideration is not constrained independently.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921999","page":["171"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..171R","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Roy, Nirupam","Frank, Stephan","Carilli, Christopher L.","Mathur, Smita","Menten, Karl M.","Wolfe, Arthur M."],"aff":["Department of Physics and Centre for Theoretical Studies, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur 721302, India;;","Department of Astronomy, The Ohio State University, Columbus, OH 43210, USA","National Radio Astronomy Observatory, P.O.

However, the magnitude of this effect and its functional dependence on metallicity have not been well characterized. In our previous paper, we compared the metallicity distribution of LGRB host galaxies to that of star-forming galaxies in the local universe. Here we build upon this work by in effect dividing one distribution by the other, and thus directly determine the relative rate of LGRB formation as a function of metallicity in the low-redshift universe. We find a dramatic cutoff in LGRB formation above a metallicity of {log}({{O}}/{{H}})+12≈ 8.3 in the KK04 scale, with LGRBs forming between 10 and 50 times more frequently per unit star formation below this cutoff than above. Furthermore, our data suggest that the rate of LGRB formation per unit star formation continues to fall above this break. We estimate that the LGRB formation rate per unit star formation may drop by as much as a factor of 100 between one-third solar and solar metallicity.","read_count":41,"citation_count":11,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921954","page":["170"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..170G","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Graham, J.

In this paper we study the propagation through interplanetary space of SEP Fe ions, injected near the Sun with a variety of charge states that are uniformly distributed in energy, by means of a 3D test particle model. In our simulations, due to gradient and curvature drifts associated with the Parker spiral magnetic field, ions of different charge propagate with very different efficiencies to an observer that is not magnetically well connected to the source region. As a result we find that, for many observer locations, the 1 au event-averaged charge state < Q> , as obtained from our model, displays an increase with particle energy E, in qualitative agreement with spacecraft observations. We conclude that drift-associated propagation is a possible explanation for the observed distribution of < Q> versus E in SEP events, and that the distribution measured in interplanetary space cannot be taken to represent that at injection.","read_count":9,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922051","page":["167"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..167D","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Dalla, S.","Marsh, M.

We revisit the massive isolated elliptical galaxy/fossil group NGC 6482 for which previous X-ray studies of a modest Chandra observation obtained a very uncertain, but also possibly very high, halo concentration. We present new measurements of the hot gas surface brightness, temperature, and iron abundance using the modest Chandra observation and a previously unpublished Suzaku observation, the latter of which allows the measurements of the gas properties to be extended out to ̃ {r}<SUB>2500</SUB>.

We explored several variants of adiabatic contraction (AC) models and, while the AC models provide fits of the same quality as the uncontracted models, they do have the following advantages: (1) lower c<SUB>200</SUB> that is less of an outlier in the ΛCDM c-M relation, and (2) baryon fractions ({f}<SUB>{{b</SUB>},200}) that agree better with the mean cosmic value. While the standard AC prescriptions yield a BCG stellar mass that is uncomfortably low compared to results from stellar population synthesis (SPS) models, a weaker AC variant that artificially shuts off cooling and star formation at z = 2 yields the same stellar mass as the uncontracted models. These are probably the reasons why our X-ray analysis prefers this weaker AC variant applied to either an NFW or Einasto DM halo. Finally, the stellar mass we measure for the BCG from the hydrostatic analysis strongly favors results from SPS models with a Chabrier or Kroupa initial mass function (IMF) over a Salpeter IMF.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921992","page":["164"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..164B","bibgroup":["CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Buote, David A."],"aff":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California at Irvine, 4129 Frederick Reines Hall, Irvine, CA 92697-4575, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/164"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["CXO:1","HEASARC:1","NED:1","SIMBAD:11"],"keyword":["dark matter","galaxies: elliptical and lenticular","cD","galaxies: formation","galaxies: groups: general","galaxies: individual: NGC 6482","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nI thank the anonymous referee for a constructively critical review that led to improvements in the manuscript.

HD 1160 B has typical mid-M dwarf-like infrared colors and a spectral type of M5.5{}<SUB>-0.5</SUB><SUP>+1.0</SUP>, where the blue edge of our Y band spectrum rules out earlier spectral types. Atmospheric modeling suggests HD 1160 B has an effective temperature of 3000-3100 K, a surface gravity of log g = 4-4.5, a radius of 1.55 ± 0.10 R <SUB>J</SUB>, and a luminosity of log L/L <SUB>☉</SUB> = -2.76 ± 0.05. Neither the primary’s Hertzspring-Russell diagram position nor atmospheric modeling of HD 1160 B show evidence for a subsolar metallicity. Interpretation of the HD 1160 B spectroscopy depends on which stellar system components are used to estimate the age. Considering HD 1160 A, B and C jointly, we derive an age of 80-125 Myr, implying that HD 1160 B straddles the hydrogen-burning limit (70-90 M <SUB>J</SUB>). If we consider HD 1160 A alone, younger ages (20-125 Myr) and a brown dwarf-like mass (35-90 M <SUB>J</SUB>) are possible. Interferometric measurements of the primary, a precise Gaia parallax, and moderate-resolution spectroscopy can better constrain the system’s age and how HD 1160 B fits within the context of (sub)stellar evolution.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921963","page":["162"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..162G","bibgroup":["Keck","ESO/Telescopes","Subaru","Gemini"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Garcia, E.

Usually, only Alfvén waves are considered for this process, although dispersive waves are also present throughout the heliosphere. We investigate resonant interaction of energetic electrons with dispersive, right-handed waves. For the interaction of particles and a single wave a variable transformation into the rest frame of the wave can be performed. Here, well-established analytic models derived in the framework of magnetostatic quasi-linear theory can be used as a reference to validate simulation results. However, this approach fails as soon as several dispersive waves are involved. Based on analytic solutions modeling the scattering amplitude in the magnetostatic limit, we present an approach to modify these equations for use in the plasma frame. Thereby we aim at a description of particle scattering in the presence of several waves. A particle-in-cell code is employed to study wave-particle scattering on a micro-physically correct level and to test the modified model equations. We investigate the interactions of electrons at different energies (from 1 keV to 1 MeV) and right-handed waves with various amplitudes. Differences between model and simulation arise in the case of high amplitudes or several waves. Analyzing the trajectories of single particles we find no microscopic diffusion in the case of a single plasma wave, although a broadening of the particle distribution can be observed.","read_count":12,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921945","page":["161"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..161S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Schreiner, C.","Kilian, P.","Spanier, F."],"aff":["Centre for Space Research, North-West University, 2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa ; Lehrstuhl für Astronomie, Universität Würzburg, D-97074 Würzburg, Germany;","Centre for Space Research, North-West University, 2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa","Centre for Space Research, North-West University, 2520 Potchefstroom, South Africa"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/161"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["plasmas","scattering","Sun: heliosphere","waves","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics - Space Physics"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"\nThe authors thank the anonymous referee for helpful comments and discussion.

For example, theoretical calculations indicated that such interactions would occur at minimum light for RR Lyrae and result in a flatter PC relation. In the past, the PC and AC relations have been investigated by using either the (V - R)<SUB>MACHO</SUB> or (V - I) colors. In this work, we extend previous work to other bands by analyzing the RR Lyraes in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 Region. Multi-epoch data are available for RR Lyraes located within the footprint of the Stripe 82 Region in five (ugriz) bands.

We found that the PC and AC relations for this sample of RR Lyraes show a complex nature in the form of flat, linear or quadratic relations. Furthermore, the PC relations at minimum light for fundamental mode RR Lyrae stars are separated according to the Oosterhoff type, especially in the (g - r)<SUB>0</SUB> and (r - I)<SUB>0</SUB> colors.

By mapping the morphology of the hot gas and analyzing its surface brightness and temperature distributions, we demonstrate the presence of a merger bow shock. We identify the presence of two jumps in surface brightness and in density located at ̃400 and ̃800 kpc from the cluster’s core. At the position of the inner jump, we detect a density jump by a factor of 2.3 ± 0.2, while at the location of the outer jump, we detect a density drop by a factor of 3.5 ± 0.7. Combining this with the temperature distribution within the cluster, we establish that the pressure of the hot gas is continuous at the 400 kpc jump, while there is a pressure change by a factor of 6.2 ± 2.8 at the 800 kpc jump. From the magnitude of the outer pressure discontinuity, using the Rankine-Hugoniot jump conditions, we determine that the sub-cluster is moving at M = 2.3 ± 0.5, or approximately 2600 ± 565 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, through the surrounding intracluster medium, creating the conditions for a bow shock. Based on these findings, we conclude that the pressure discontinuity is likely the result of an ongoing major merger between two massive clusters. Since few observations of bow shocks in clusters have been made, this detection can contribute to the study of the dynamics of cluster mergers, which offers insight into how the most massive clusters may have formed.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921941","page":["159"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..159E","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes","CXC","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Emery, Deanna L.","Bogdán, Ákos","Kraft, Ralph P.","Andrade-Santos, Felipe","Forman, William R.","Hardcastle, Martin J.","Jones, Christine"],"aff":["Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","School of Physics, Astronomy and Mathematics, University of Hertfordshire, College Lane, Hatfield, Hertfordshire AL10 9AB, UK","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-1183-648X","-","-","-","0000-0002-9478-1682","-","-"],"issue":"2","orcid_other":["-","-","-","-","0000-0002-9478-1682","-","-"],"volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/159"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["CXO:3","NED:1","SIMBAD:4"],"keyword":["galaxies: clusters: general","galaxies: clusters: individual: 3C 438","galaxies: clusters: intracluster medium","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the referee for the constructive comments that have helped us to improve the paper.

Characteristics of the shock determined from multi-point imaging observations are compared to in situ measurements at different locations and a complex radio type II burst, which according to our definition has multiple branches that may not all be fundamental-harmonic related. The white-light shock signature can be modeled reasonably well by a spherical structure and was expanding backward even on the opposite side of the Sun. The expansion of the shock, which was roughly self-similar after the first ̃1.5 hr from launch, largely dominated over the translation of the shock center for the time period of interest. Our study also suggests a bow-shock morphology around the nose at later times due to the outward motion in combination with the expansion of the ejecta. The shock decayed and failed to reach Mercury in the backward direction and the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory B (STEREO B) and Venus in the lateral directions, as indicated by the imaging and in situ observations. The shock in the nose direction, however, may have persisted to the far outer heliosphere, with predicted impact on Dawn around 06:00 UT on July 25 and on Jupiter around 23:30 UT on July 27 by a magnetohydrodynamic model. The type II burst shows properties generally consistent with the spatial/temporal variations of the shock deduced from imaging and in situ observations. In particular, the low-frequency bands agree well with the in situ measurements of a very low density ahead of the shock at STEREO A.","read_count":35,"citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922081","page":["158"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..158L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Liu, Ying D.","Hu, Huidong","Zhu, Bei","Luhmann, Janet G.","Vourlidas, Angelos"],"aff":["State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China;","State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China","State Key Laboratory of Space Weather, National Space Science Center, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China","Space Sciences Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA","The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD 20732, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-3483-5909","0000-0001-8188-9013","0000-0001-6306-3365","-","0000-0002-8164-5948"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/158"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["shock waves","solar-terrestrial relations","solar wind","Sun: coronal mass ejections: CMEs","Sun: radio radiation","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"\nThe research was supported by the Recruitment Program of Global Experts of China, NSFC under grant 41374173, and the Specialized Research Fund for State Key Laboratories of China.

We model the periodograms (temporal power spectra) of the observed light curves as simple power-law noise (red noise, spectral power P(f)\\propto {f}<SUP>-β </SUP>) using Monte Carlo simulations, taking into account windowing effects (red-noise leak, aliasing). The power spectra of 39 (out of 43) sources are in good agreement with the models, yielding a range in power spectral index (β) from ≈1 to ≈3. We fit a Gaussian function to each flare in a given light curve to obtain the flare duration. We discover a correlation between β and the median duration of the flares. We use the derivative of a light curve to obtain a characteristic variability timescale, which does not depend on the assumed functional form of the flares, incomplete fitting, and so on. We find that, once the effects of relativistic Doppler boosting are corrected for, the variability timescales of our sources are proportional to the accretion rate to the power of 0.25 ± 0.03 over five orders of magnitude in accretion rate, regardless of source type. We further find that modeling the periodograms of four of our sources requires the assumption of broken power-law spectra. From simulating light curves as superpositions of exponential flares, we conclude that strong overlap of flares leads to featureless simple power-law periodograms of AGNs at radio wavelengths in most cases.

The observations can be explained by invoking two stellar generations with different ages and metallicities or by a single generation of stars composed of two populations characterized by different rotation rates. We analyzed the number ratios of stars belonging to both main-sequence components in NGC 1856 as a function of radius. We found that their number ratios remain approximately unchanged from the cluster’s central region to its periphery, indicating that both components are homogeneously distributed in space. Through a comparison of the loci of the best-fitting isochrones with the ridge lines of both stellar components, we found that both multiple stellar populations and rapid stellar rotation can potentially explain the observed main-sequence bifurcation in NGC 1856. However, if NGC 1856 were a young representative of the old globular clusters, then the multiple stellar populations model would not be able to explain the observed homogeneity in the spatial distributions of these two components, since all relevant scenarios would predict that the second stellar generation should be formed in a more compact configuration than that of the first stellar generation, while NGC 1856 is too young for both stellar generations to have been fully mixed dynamically. We speculate that the rapid stellar rotation scenario would be the favored explanation of the observed multiple stellar sequences in NGC 1856.","citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922060","page":["156"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..156L","bibgroup":["HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Li, Chengyuan","de Grijs, Richard","Deng, Licai","Milone, Antonino P."],"aff":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW 2109, Australia","Kavli Institute for Astronomy & Astrophysics and Department of Astronomy, Peking University, Yi He Yuan Lu 5, Hai Dian District, Beijing 100871, China ; International Space Science Institute—Beijing, 1 Nanertiao, Zhongguancun, Hai Dian District, Beijing 100190, China","Key Laboratory for Optical Astronomy, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 20A Datun Road, Chaoyang District, Beijing 100012, China","Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics, Australian National University, Mt Stromlo Observatory, Cotter Road, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-7203-5996","0000-0001-9073-9914","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/156"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["ESA:1","MAST:1","SIMBAD:10"],"keyword":["globular clusters: individual: NGC 1856","Hertzsprung─Russell and C─M diagrams","Magellanic Clouds","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank M.

The two surveys preferentially detect different forms of neutral gas due to their sensitivity. We adopt a machine learning approach to divide our data into two populations that separate across a range in column density: (1) a narrow line-width population typical of the majority of bright high velocity cloud components, and (2) a fainter, broad line-width population that aligns well with that of the population found in the Green Bank survey. We refer to these populations as dense and diffuse gas, respectively, and find that diffuse gas is typically located at the edges and in the tails of high velocity clouds, surrounding dense components in the core. A fit to the average spectrum of each type of gas in the Galactic All Sky Survey data reveals the dense population to have a typical line width of ̃20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and brightness temperature of ̃0.3 K, while the diffuse population has a typical line width of ̃30 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and a brightness temperature of ̃0.2 K. Our results confirm that most surveys of high velocity gas in the Milky Way halo are missing the majority of the ubiquitous diffuse gas, and that this gas is likely to contribute at least as much mass as the dense gas.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922075","page":["155"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..155M","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Moss, V.

While it is well known that certain orientation parameters can reduce uncertainty in other related parameters, it was also hoped that the detection of an electromagnetic signal in conjunction with a GW could augment the measurement precision of the mass and spin from the gravitational signal itself. That is, knowledge of the sky location, inclination, and redshift of a binary could break degeneracies between these extrinsic, coordinate-dependent parameters and the physical parameters that are intrinsic to the binary. In this paper, we investigate this issue by assuming perfect knowledge of extrinsic parameters, and assessing the maximal impact of this knowledge on our ability to extract intrinsic parameters. We recover similar gains in extrinsic recovery to earlier work; however, we find only modest improvements in a few intrinsic parameters—namely the primary component’s spin. We thus conclude that, even in the best case, the use of additional information from electromagnetic observations does not improve the measurement of the intrinsic parameters significantly.","read_count":44,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922020","page":["154"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..154P","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Pankow, Chris","Sampson, Laura","Perri, Leah","Chase, Eve","Coughlin, Scott","Zevin, Michael","Kalogera, Vassiliki"],"aff":["Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration and Research in Astrophysics (CIERA) and Department of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, 2145 Sheridan Road, Evanston, IL 60208, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-1128-3662","-","-","-","-","-","0000-0001-9236-5469"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/154"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["black hole physics","gravitational waves","methods: data analysis","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["Astrophysical Prior Information and Gravitational-wave Parameter Estimation"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T22:15:54.079Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161107564Z"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161107564Z","2017ApJ...834..153Z","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/153","2016arXiv161107564Z","1611.07564","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/153"],"first_author":"Zeng, Houdun","abstract":"Multi-wavelength observations of mature supernova remnants (SNRs), especially with recent advances in γ-ray astronomy, make it possible to constrain energy distribution of energetic particles within these remnants. In consideration of the SNR origin of Galactic cosmic rays and physics related to particle acceleration and radiative processes, we use a simple one-zone model to fit the nonthermal emission spectra of three shell-type SNRs located within 2° on the sky: RX J1713.7-3946, CTB 37B, and CTB 37A. Although radio images of these three sources all show a shell (or half-shell) structure, their radio, X-ray, and γ-ray spectra are quite different, offering an ideal case to explore evolution of energetic particle distribution in SNRs. Our spectral fitting shows that (1) the particle distribution becomes harder with aging of these SNRs, implying a continuous acceleration process, and the particle distributions of CTB 37A and CTB 37B in the GeV range are harder than the hardest distribution that can be produced at a shock via the linear diffusive shock particle acceleration process, so spatial transport may play a role; (2) the energy loss timescale of electrons at the high-energy cutoff due to synchrotron radiation appears to be always a bit (within a factor of a few) shorter than the age of the corresponding remnant, which also requires continuous particle acceleration; (3) double power-law distributions are needed to fit the spectra of CTB 37B and CTB 37A, which may be attributed to shock interaction with molecular clouds.","citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922037","page":["153"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..153Z","bibgroup":["CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zeng, Houdun","Xin, Yuliang","Liu, Siming","Jokipii, J.

Recent measurements have shown its near-infrared transmission spectrum to be flat, pointing to a high-altitude opacity source in the exoplanet's atmosphere, either equilibrium condensate clouds or photochemical hazes. Many photometric observations have been reported in the optical by different groups, though simultaneous measurements spanning the entire optical regime are lacking. We present an optical transmission spectrum (4500-9260 Å) of GJ 1214b in 14 bins, measured with Magellan/IMACS repeatedly over three transits. We measure a mean planet-to-star radius ratio of {R}<SUB>p</SUB>/{R}<SUB>s</SUB>=0.1146+/- 2× {10}<SUP>-4</SUP> and mean uncertainty of σ ({R}<SUB>p</SUB>/{R}<SUB>s</SUB>)=8.7× {10}<SUP>-4</SUP> in the spectral bins. The optical transit depths are shallower on average than observed in the near-infrared. We present a model for jointly incorporating the effects of a composite photosphere and atmospheric transmission through the exoplanet's limb (the CPAT model), and use it to examine the cases of absorber and temperature heterogeneities in the stellar photosphere. We find the optical and near-infrared measurements are best explained by the combination of (1) photochemical haze in the exoplanetary atmosphere with a mode particle size r = 0.1 μm and haze-forming efficiency {f}<SUB>{haze</SUB>}=10 % and (2) faculae in the unocculted stellar disk with a temperature contrast {{∆ }}T={354}<SUB>-46</SUB><SUP>+46</SUP> K, assuming 3.2% surface coverage.

This work investigates the dependence of flare activity on the AR properties and clarifies the influence of AR magnetic parameters on the flare productivity, based on two data sets of daily sunspot and flare information as well as the GOES soft X-ray measurements and HMI vector magnetograms. By considering the evolution of magnetic complexity, we find that flare behaviors are quite different in the short- and long-lived complex ARs and the ARs with more complex magnetic configurations are likely to host more impulsive and intense flares. Furthermore, we investigate several magnetic quantities and perform the two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to examine the similarity/difference between two populations in different types of ARs. Our results demonstrate that the total source field strength on the photosphere has a good correlation with the flare activity in complex ARs. It is noted that intense flares tend to occur at the regions of strong source field in combination with an intermediate field-weighted shear angle. This result implies that the magnetic free energy provided by a complex AR could be high enough to trigger a flare eruption even with a moderate magnetic shear on the photosphere. We thus suggest that the magnetic free energy represented by the source field rather than the photospheric magnetic complexity is a better quantity to characterize the flare productivity of an AR, especially for the occurrence of intense flares.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922073","page":["150"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..150Y","identifier":["2017ApJ...834..150Y","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/150","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/150"],"bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Yang, Ya-Hui","Hsieh, Min-Shiu","Yu, Hsiu-Shan","Chen, P.

At low temperatures ({T}<SUB>0</SUB>≲ 300-1000 {{K}}, depending on model parameters), the accreted material has a lower entropy than the interior.

Each galaxy was imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), and the absorption was detected in COS/HST spectra of nearby (D< 200 kpc) background quasars. We use the pixel-velocity two-point correlation function to characterize the velocity spread of the absorbers, which is a method used previously for a sample of Mg II absorber-galaxy pairs. The absorption velocity spread for O VI is more extended than Mg II, which suggests that the two ions trace differing components of the CGM. Again, in contrast to Mg II, the O VI absorption velocity spreads are similar regardless of galaxy color, inclination, and azimuthal angle. This indicates that the kinematics of the high-ionization gas is not strongly influenced by the current star formation activity in the galaxy. The kinematic homogeneity of O VI absorption and its tendency to be observed mainly along the projected galaxy major and minor axes is likely due to varying ionization conditions and gas densities about the galaxy. Gas in intermediate azimuthal angles may be ionized out of the O VI phase, possibly resulting in an azimuthal angle dependence of the distribution of gas in higher ionization states.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922065","page":["148"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..148N","bibgroup":["HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Nielsen, Nikole M.","Kacprzak, Glenn G.","Muzahid, Sowgat","Churchill, Christopher W.","Murphy, Michael T.","Charlton, Jane C."],"aff":["Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Victoria 3122, Australia","Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Victoria 3122, Australia","Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, The Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA 16801, USA; Leiden Observatory, Leiden University, PO Box 9513, NL-2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands","Department of Astronomy, New Mexico State University, Las Cruces, NM 88003, USA","Centre for Astrophysics and Supercomputing, Swinburne University of Technology, Hawthorn, Victoria 3122, Australia","Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, The Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA 16801, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-2377-8352","-","0000-0003-3938-8762","0000-0002-9125-8159","-","-"],"issue":"2","orcid_other":["-","-","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/148"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["ESA:1","MAST:1"],"keyword":["galaxies: halos","quasars: absorption lines","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nSupport for this research was provided by NASA through grants HST GO-13398 from the Space Telescope Science Institute, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555.

There are 21 sets of multiplets identified, including four sets of multiplets with l = 1, nine sets of multiplets with l = 2, and eight sets of multiplets with l = 3. In particular, there are three complete triplets (f<SUB>10</SUB>, f<SUB>12</SUB>, f<SUB>14</SUB>), (f<SUB>31</SUB>, f<SUB>34</SUB>, f<SUB>35</SUB>), and (f<SUB>41</SUB>, f<SUB>43</SUB>, f<SUB>44</SUB>).

To overcome these barriers, spatial concentration of centimeter-sized dust pebbles and subsequent gravitational collapse have been proposed. However, numerical investigations have shown that dust aggregates may undergo fragmentation during the gravitational collapse phase. This fragmentation in turn changes the size distribution of the solids and thus must be taken into account in order to understand the properties of the planetesimals that form. To explore the fate of dust pebbles undergoing fragmenting collisions, we conducted laboratory experiments on dust-aggregate collisions with a focus on establishing a collision model for this stage of planetesimal formation. In our experiments, we analyzed collisions of dust aggregates with masses between 0.7 and 91 g mass ratios between target and projectile from 1 to 126 at a fixed porosity of 65%, within the velocity range of 1.5-8.7 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>, at low atmospheric pressure of ̃10<SUP>-3</SUP> mbar, and in free-fall conditions. We derived the mass of the largest fragment, the fragment size/mass distribution, and the efficiency of mass transfer as a function of collision velocity and projectile/target aggregate size. Moreover, we give recipes for an easy-to-use fragmentation and mass-transfer model for further use in modeling work. In a companion paper, we use the experimental findings and the derived dust-aggregate collision model to investigate the fate of dust pebbles during gravitational collapse.","read_count":21,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921938","page":["145"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..145B","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Bukhari Syed, M.","Blum, J.","Wahlberg Jansson, K.","Johansen, A."],"aff":["Institut für Geophysik und extraterrestrische Physik, Technische Universität zu Braunschweig, Mendelssohnstr. 3, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Institut für Geophysik und extraterrestrische Physik, Technische Universität zu Braunschweig, Mendelssohnstr. 3, D-38106 Braunschweig, Germany","Lund Observatory, Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics, Lund University, Box 43, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden","Lund Observatory, Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics, Lund University, Box 43, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/145"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["comets: general","methods: laboratory","planets and satellites: formation","protoplanetary disks","techniques: image processing","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe are thankful to Kathrin Gebauer, Bernd Stoll, and Ingo von Borstel for their technical assistance in constructing the drop tower.

The simulations model the interaction between a hot wind driven by supernova explosions and a cooler, denser cloud of interstellar or circumgalactic media. By resolving scales of {{∆ }}x< 0.1 pc over > 100 pc distances, our calculations capture how the cloud disruption leads to a distribution of densities and temperatures in the resulting multiphase outflow and quantify the mass and momentum associated with each phase. We find that the multiphase wind contains comparable mass and momenta in phases over a wide range of densities and temperatures extending from the hot wind (n≈ {10}<SUP>-2.5</SUP> {{cm}}<SUP>-3</SUP>, T≈ {10}<SUP>6.5</SUP> K) to the coldest components (n≈ {10}<SUP>2</SUP> {{cm}}<SUP>-3</SUP>, T≈ {10}<SUP>2</SUP> K). We further find that the momentum distributes roughly in proportion to the mass in each phase, and the mass loading of the hot phase by the destruction of cold, dense material is an efficient process. These results provide new insight into the physical origin of observed multiphase galactic outflows and inform galaxy formation models that include coarser treatments of galactic winds. Our results confirm that cool gas observed in outflows at large distances from the galaxy (≳ 1 kpc) likely does not originate through the entrainment of cold material near the central starburst.","read_count":72,"citation_count":15,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921916","page":["144"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..144S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Schneider, Evan E.","Robertson, Brant E."],"aff":["Steward Observatory, University of Arizona, 933 North Cherry Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA","Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of California, Santa Cruz, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-9735-7484","0000-0002-4271-0364"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/144"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:1"],"keyword":["galaxies: evolution","hydrodynamics","ISM: clouds","supernovae: general","turbulence","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe acknowledge inspiration from the 2014 and 2016 Simons Symposia on Galactic Superwinds: Beyond Phenomenology.

The individual distances to sources in the complex are fully consistent with each other, and the mean value corresponds to a distance of 436.0 ± 9.2 pc for the Serpens/W40 complex.

Enough VLBA detections have now been obtained for 16 stellar systems in Ophiuchus to derive their parallax and proper motion. This leads to distance determinations for individual stars with an accuracy of 0.3 to a few percent. In addition, the orbits of six multiple systems were modelled by combining absolute positions with VLBA (and, in some cases, near-infrared) angular separations. Twelve stellar systems are located in the dark cloud Lynds 1688 the individual distances for this sample are highly consistent with one another and yield a mean parallax for Lynds 1688 of \\varpi =7.28+/- 0.06 mas, corresponding to a distance d=137.3+/- 1.2 pc. This represents an accuracy greater than 1%. Three systems for which astrometric elements could be measured are located in the eastern streamer (Lynds 1689) and yield an estimate of \\varpi =6.79+/- 0.16 mas, corresponding to a distance d=147.3+/- 3.4 pc. This suggests that the eastern streamer is located about 10 pc farther than the core, but this conclusion needs to be confirmed by observations of additional sources in the eastern streamer (currently being collected). From the measured proper motions, we estimate the one-dimensional velocity dispersion in Lynds 1688 to be 2.8 ± 1.8 and 3.0 ± 2.0 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, in R.A. and decl., respectively; these are larger than, but still consistent within 1σ of, those found in other studies.","citation_count":17,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922076","page":["141"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..141O","bibgroup":["NRAO","Leiden Observatory","NRAO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Ortiz-León, Gisela N.","Loinard, Laurent","Kounkel, Marina A.","Dzib, Sergio A.","Mioduszewski, Amy J.","Rodríguez, Luis F.","Torres, Rosa M.","González-Lópezlira, Rosa A.","Pech, Gerardo","Rivera, Juana L.","Hartmann, Lee","Boden, Andrew F.","Evans, Neal J., II","Briceño, Cesar","Tobin, John J.","Galli, Phillip A.

We report the detection of radio continuum emission in 5 out of the 10 objects (RXJ1615, UX Tau A, LkCa15, RXJ1633, and SR 24s). In the case of LkCa15, the centimeter emission is extended, and has a similar morphology to that of the transitional disk observed at millimeter wavelengths with an inner depression. For these five detections, we construct the spectral energy distributions from the centimeter to submillimeter wavelengths, and find that they can be well fitted with a single (RXJ1633 and UX Tau A) or a two-component power law (LkCa15, RXJ1615, and SR 24s). For the cases where a single power law fits the data well, the centimeter emission is likely produced by optically thin dust with large grains (I.e., centimeter-size pebbles) present in the transitional disks. For the cases where a double power law fits the data, the centimeter emission might be produced by the combination of photoevaporation and a free-free jet. We conclude that RXJ1633 and UX Tau A are excellent examples of transitional disks where the structure of the emission from centimeter/millimeter pebbles can be studied. In the other cases, some other physical emitting mechanisms are also important in the centimeter regime.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921980","page":["138"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..138Z","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zapata, Luis A.","Rodríguez, Luis F.","Palau, Aina"],"aff":["Instituto de Radioastronomía y Astrofísica, UNAM, Apdo.

We have used multi-frequency data to measure the interstellar scattering properties of some of these pulsars. Most of the pulsars have properties that mirror those of the previously known pulsar population, although four show some notable characteristics. PSRs J1907+0631 and J1925+1720 are young and are associated with supernova remnants or plerionic nebulae: J1907+0631 lies close to the center of SNR G40.5-0.5, while J1925+1720 is coincident with a high-energy Fermi γ-ray source. One pulsar, J1932+1500, is in a surprisingly eccentric, 199 day binary orbit with a companion having a minimum mass of 0.33 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. Several of the sources exhibit timing noise, and two, PSRs J0611+1436 and J1907+0631, have both suffered large glitches, but with very different post-glitch rotation properties. In particular, the rotational period of PSR J0611+1436 will not recover to its pre-glitch value for about 12 years, a far greater recovery timescale than seen following any other large glitches.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922007","page":["137"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..137L","bibgroup":["NRAO","XMM"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Lyne, A.

Such modes may be used as unique probes of the complicated chemical stratification that results from several processes that occurred in previous evolutionary phases of intermediate-mass stars. This effort is part of our ongoing quest for more credible and realistic seismic models of white dwarfs using static, parametrized equilibrium structures. Inspired by successful techniques developed in design optimization fields (such as aerodynamics), we exploit Akima splines for the tracing of the chemical profile of oxygen (carbon) in the core of a white dwarf model. A series of tests are then presented to better seize the precision and significance of the results that can be obtained in an asteroseismological context. We also show that the new parametrization passes an essential basic test, as it successfully reproduces the chemical stratification of a full evolutionary model.","read_count":34,"citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922033","page":["136"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..136G","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Giammichele, N.","Charpinet, S.","Fontaine, G.","Brassard, P."],"aff":["Département de Physique, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada; Université de Toulouse, UPS-OMP, IRAP, Toulouse F-31400, France; CNRS, IRAP, 14 avenue Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France","Université de Toulouse, UPS-OMP, IRAP, Toulouse F-31400, France; CNRS, IRAP, 14 avenue Edouard Belin, F-31400 Toulouse, France","Département de Physique, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada","Département de Physique, Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-4014-719X","-","0000-0002-2357-1012","-"],"issue":"2","orcid_other":["-","0000-0002-6018-6180","-","-"],"volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/136"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:4"],"keyword":["stars: interiors","stars: oscillations","white dwarfs","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis work was supported in part by the NSERC Canada through a doctoral fellowship awarded to N.G., and through a research grant awarded to G.F.

We detect significant 870 μm continuum emission in 16 (64%) of these galaxies. The high-resolution maps reveal that the dust emission is mostly radiated from a single region close to the galaxy center. Exploiting the visibility data taken over a wide uv distance range, we measure the half-light radii of the rest-frame far-infrared emission for the best sample of 12 massive galaxies with log(M<SUB>*</SUB>/M<SUB>☉</SUB>) > 11. We find nine galaxies to be associated with extremely compact dust emission with R<SUB>1/2,870 μm</SUB> < 1.5 kpc, which is more than a factor of 2 smaller than their rest-optical sizes, < {R}<SUB>1/2,1.6μ {{m</SUB>}}> =3.2 {kpc}, and is comparable with optical sizes of massive quiescent galaxies at similar redshifts. As they have an exponential disk with Sérsic index of < {n}<SUB>1.6μ {{m</SUB>}}> =1.2 in the rest-optical, they are likely to be in the transition phase from extended disks to compact spheroids.

Moreover, ionized gas kinematics reveal that they are rotation supported with an angular momentum as large as that of typical star-forming galaxies at z = 1-3.

This hybrid model is constructed by allowing the surface flux transport (SFT) simulation described in Lemerle et al. to provide the poloidal source term to an axisymmetric FTD simulation defined in a meridional plane, which in turn generates the BMRs required by the SFT. A key aspect of this coupling is the definition of an emergence function describing the probability of BMR emergence as a function of the spatial distribution of the internal axisymmetric magnetic field. We use a genetic algorithm to calibrate this function, together with other model parameters, against observed cycle 21 emergence data. We present a reference dynamo solution reproducing many solar cycle characteristics, including good hemispheric coupling, phase relationship between the surface dipole and the BMR-generating internal field, and correlation between dipole strength at cycle maximum and peak amplitude of the next cycle. The saturation of the cycle amplitude takes place through the quenching of the BMR tilt as a function of the internal field. The observed statistical scatter about the mean BMR tilt, built into the model, acts as a source of stochasticity which dominates amplitude fluctuations. The model thus can produce Dalton-like epochs of strongly suppressed cycle amplitude lasting a few cycles and can even shut off entirely following an unfavorable sequence of emergence events.","read_count":18,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922083","page":["133"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..133L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Lemerle, Alexandre","Charbonneau, Paul"],"aff":["Département de physique, Université de Montréal, 2900 Boulevard Édouard-Montpetit, Montréal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada; Collège de Bois-de-Boulogne, 10555 Avenue Bois-de-Boulogne, Montréal, QC, H4N 1L4, Canada;","Département de physique, Université de Montréal, 2900 Boulevard Édouard-Montpetit, Montréal, QC, H3T 1J4, Canada"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-8314-4007","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/133"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["dynamo","Sun: activity","Sun: interior","Sun: magnetic fields","Sun: photosphere","sunspots","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe wish to thank Yi-Ming Wang and Neil R.

I have analyzed the possible singularities in the integral of scattering angle. There are possible singularities in the case of an attractive potential. This may result in a problem for the numerical integral. In order to avoid the problem, I have used a proper scheme, e.g., splitting into many subintervals where the width of each subinterval is determined by the variation of the integrand, to calculate the scattering angle. The collision integrals are calculated by using Romberg’s method, therefore the accuracy is high (I.e., ̃10<SUP>-12</SUP>). The results of collision integrals and their derivatives for -7 ≤ ψ ≤ 5 are listed. By using Hermite polynomial interpolation from those data, the collision integrals can be obtained with an accuracy of 10<SUP>-10</SUP>. For very weakly coupled plasma (ψ ≥ 4.5), analytical fittings for collision integrals are available with an accuracy of 10<SUP>-11</SUP>. I have compared the final results of resistance coefficients with other works and found that, for a repulsive potential, the results are basically the same as others’ for an attractive potential, the results in cases of intermediate and strong coupling show significant differences. The resulting resistance coefficients are tested in the solar model. Comparing with the widely used models of Cox et al. and Thoul et al., the resistance coefficients in the screened Coulomb potential lead to a slightly weaker effect in the solar model, which is contrary to the expectation of attempts to solve the solar abundance problem.","read_count":21,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922100","page":["132"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..132Z","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zhang, Q.

We also find lags that show a nearly monotonic trend with energy, with the highest-energy photons arriving first. The covariance spectrum of the lower kHz QPO is well fit by a thermal Comptonization model, though we find a seed photon temperature higher than that of the mean spectrum, which was also seen in Peille et al. and indicates the possibility of a composite boundary layer emitting region.

We focus here on a particularly intense episode preceeding a definitive decline of the source activity. We benefit from large signal-to-noise ratios to investigate the source spectral variability, on a timescale of five minutes. A hardness-intensity study of three broad bands reveals clearly different behaviors at low and high energy (below and above ̃100 keV). In particular, on two occasions, the source intensity varies by a factor of 3-4 in amplitude while keeping the same spectral shape. On the other hand, at the end of the major flare, the emission presents a clear anticorrelation between flux and hardness. These behaviors strongly suggest the presence of two spectral components related to emission processes varying in a largely independent way. The first component (E < 100-150 keV) is classically identified with a Comptonizing thermal electron population, and requires either an unusual seed photon population or a specific geometry with strong absorbing/reflecting material. The second component is modeled by a cutoff power-law, which could correspond to a second hotter Comptonizing population or another mechanism (synchrotron, non-thermal Comptonization...). In the framework of such a model, hardness-intensity and flux-flux diagrams clearly demonstrate that the source evolution follows a well-organized underlying scheme. They reveal unique information about the hard X-ray emission processes and connections between them.

However, recent studies suggest that at short timescales, such as soon after solar energetic particle (SEP) injection, particles remain on turbulently meandering field lines, which results in nondiffusive initial propagation across the mean magnetic field. In this work, we use a new technique to investigate how the particles are displaced from their original field lines, and we quantify the parameters of the transition from field-aligned particle propagation along meandering field lines to particle diffusion across the mean magnetic field. We show that the initial decoupling of the particles from the field lines is slow, and particles remain within a Larmor radius from their initial meandering field lines for tens to hundreds of Larmor periods, for 0.1-10 MeV protons in turbulence conditions typical of the solar wind at 1 au. Subsequently, particles decouple from their initial field lines and after hundreds to thousands of Larmor periods reach time-asymptotic diffusive behavior consistent with particle diffusion across the mean field caused by the meandering of the field lines. We show that the typical duration of the prediffusive phase, hours to tens of hours for 10 MeV protons in 1 au solar wind turbulence conditions, is significant for SEP propagation to 1 au and must be taken into account when modeling SEP propagation in the interplanetary space.","read_count":14,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922012","page":["127"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..127L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Laitinen, T.","Dalla, S."],"aff":["Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK","Jeremiah Horrocks Institute, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, UK"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-7719-7783","0000-0002-7837-5780"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/127"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["diffusion","magnetic fields","Sun: particle emission","turbulence","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Space Physics"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"\nT.L. and S.D. acknowledge support from the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) (grants ST/J001341/1 and ST/M00760X/1) and the International Space Science Institute as part of international team 297.

The high quality of the resulting DHIGLS products enables a variety of new studies in directions of low Galactic column density. We analyze the angular power spectra of maps of the integrated H I emission (column density) from the data cubes for several distinct velocity ranges. In fitting power-spectrum models based on a power law, but including the effects of the synthesized beam and noise at high spatial frequencies, we find exponents ranging from -2.5 to -3.0.

These exponents are interpreted as being representative of the three-dimensional density and velocity fields of the atomic gas, respectively. We find evidence for dramatic changes in the H I structures in channel maps over even small changes in velocity.

We numerically explore one of the chondrule forming processes—planetesimal collisions. Previous studies have found that impact jetting via protoplanet-planetesimal collisions can make chondrules with 1% of the impactors’ mass, when the impact velocity exceeds 2.5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Based on the mineralogical data of chondrules, undifferentiated planetesimals would be more suitable for chondrule-forming collisions than potentially differentiated protoplanets. We examine planetesimal-planetesimal collisions using a shock physics code and find two things: one is that planetesimal-planetesimal collisions produce nearly the same amount of chondrules as protoplanet-planetesimal collisions (̃1%). The other is that the amount of produced chondrules becomes larger as the impact velocity increases when two planetesimals collide with each other. We also find that progenitors of chondrules can originate from deeper regions of large targets (planetesimals or protoplanets) than small impactors (planetesimals). The composition of targets is therefore important, to fully account for the mineralogical data of currently sampled chondrules.","read_count":52,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921915","page":["125"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..125W","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Wakita, Shigeru","Matsumoto, Yuji","Oshino, Shoichi","Hasegawa, Yasuhiro"],"aff":["Center for Computational Astrophysics, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan","Center for Computational Astrophysics, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan;  Planetary Exploration Research Center, Narashino, Chiba 275-0016, Japan","Center for Computational Astrophysics, National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-3161-3454","-","0000-0002-2794-6029","0000-0002-9017-3663"],"issue":"2","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/125"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["meteorites","meteors","meteoroids","minor planets","asteroids: general","planets and satellites: formation","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe gratefully acknowledge the developers of iSALE-2D, including Gareth Collins, Kai Wunnemann, Dirk Elbeshausen, Boris Ivanov and Jay Melosh.

Surprisingly, the Suzaku spectrum of this knot shows no emission from Cr, Mn, or Ni, which is unusual for the Fe-rich regions in this SNR.

These constraints rule out the deep, dense core of a Chandrasekhar-mass white dwarf as the origin of the Fe knot and favor either incomplete Si burning or an α-rich freeze-out regime, probably close to the boundary.

We implement jets into a well-established three-dimensional, two-temperature magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solar corona model employing Alfvén-wave dissipation to produce a realistic solar-wind background. The jets are produced by positioning a compact magnetic dipole under the solar surface and rotating the boundary plasma around the dipole's magnetic axis. The moving plasma drags the magnetic field lines along with it, ultimately leading to a reconnection-driven jet similar to that described by Pariat et al. We compare line-of-sight synthetic images to multiple jet observations at EUV and X-ray bands, and find very close matches in terms of physical structure, dynamics, and emission. Key contributors to this agreement are the greatly enhanced plasma density and temperature in our jets compared to previous models. These enhancements arise from the comprehensive thermodynamic model that we use and, also, our inclusion of a dense chromosphere at the base of our jet-generating regions. We further find that the large-scale corona is affected significantly by the outwardly propagating torsional Alfvén waves generated by our polar jet, across 40° in latitude and out to 24 R<SUB>☉</SUB>. We estimate that polar jets contribute only a few percent to the steady-state solar-wind energy outflow.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922086","page":["123"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..123S","identifier":["2017ApJ...834..123S","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/123","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/123"],"bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Szente, J.","Toth, G.","Manchester, W.

These spectra allow us to untangle five components of the system: the photosphere and magnetosphere of star B, the jet, scattering properties of the ring material, and excess near-infrared (near-IR) radiation previously attributed to a possible self-luminous planet. We confirm an early-K subgiant classification for star B and show that the magnetospheric He I emission line is variable, possibly indicating increased mass accretion at certain times. As expected, the H<SUB>2</SUB> emission features associated with the inner part of the jet show no variation with orbital phase. We show that the reflectance spectrum for the scattered light has a distinctive blue slope and spectral features consistent with scattering and absorption by a mixture of water and methane ice grains in the 1-50 μm size range. This suggests that the methane frost line is closer than ̃5 au in this system, requiring that the grains be shielded from direct radiation. After correcting for features from the scattered light, jet, magnetosphere, and photosphere, we confirm the presence of leftover near-IR light from an additional source, detectable near minimum brightness. A spectral emission feature matching the model spectrum of a 10 M<SUB>J</SUB>, 1 Myr old planet is found in the excess flux, but other expected features from this model are not seen. Our observations, therefore, tentatively support the picture that a luminous planet is present within the system, although they cannot yet be considered definitive.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921966","page":["119"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..119A","bibgroup":["Gemini"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Arulanantham, Nicole A.","Herbst, William","Gilmore, Martha S.","Cauley, P.

The source exhibits signs of substantial geometric asphericity, X-rays from persistent interaction with circumstellar material (CSM), thermal emission from warm dust, and a light curve that appears intermediate between supernovae of Types II-P and II-L. The proximity of this source motivates a close inspection of these physical characteristics and their potential interconnection. We present multiepoch spectropolarimetry of SN 2013ej during the first 107 days and deep optical spectroscopy and ultraviolet through infrared photometry past ̃800 days. SN 2013ej exhibits the strongest and most persistent continuum and line polarization ever observed for a SN of its class during the recombination phase. Modeling indicates that the data are consistent with an oblate ellipsoidal photosphere, viewed nearly edge-on and probably augmented by optical scattering from circumstellar dust. We suggest that interaction with an equatorial distribution of CSM, perhaps the result of binary evolution, is responsible for generating the photospheric asphericity. Relatedly, our late-time optical imaging and spectroscopy show that asymmetric CSM interaction is ongoing, and the morphology of broad Hα emission from shock-excited ejecta provides additional evidence that the geometry of the interaction region is ellipsoidal. Alternatively, a prolate ellipsoidal geometry from an intrinsically bipolar explosion is also a plausible interpretation of the data but would probably require a ballistic jet of radioactive material capable of penetrating the hydrogen envelope early in the recombination phase. Finally, our latest space-based optical imaging confirms that the late interaction-powered light curve dropped below the stellar progenitor level, confirming the RSG star’s association with the explosion.","citation_count":15,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922087","page":["118"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..118M","bibgroup":["Keck","Spitzer","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mauerhan, Jon C.","Van Dyk, Schuyler D.","Johansson, Joel","Hu, Maokai","Fox, Ori D.","Wang, Lifan","Graham, Melissa L.","Filippenko, Alexei V.","Shivvers, Isaac"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, University of California, Berkeley, CA 94720-3411, USA","Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, California Institute of Technology, 1200 E.

As the host star evolves off the main sequence to become a white dwarf, these planets can be engulfed during the giant phase, triggering secular instabilities and leading to the tidal disruptions of small rocky bodies. These disrupted bodies can feed the white dwarfs with rocky material and possibly explain the high-metallicity material in their atmospheres. We illustrate how this mechanism can operate when the gravitational perturbations are due to the KL mechanism from a stellar binary companion, a process that is activated only after the planet has been removed/engulfed. We show that this mechanism can explain the observed accretion rates if: (1) the planetary engulfment happens rapidly compared to the secular timescale, which is generally the case for wide binaries (> 100 au) and planetary engulfment during the asymptotic giant branch; (2) the planetesimal disk has a total mass of ̃ {10}<SUP>-4</SUP>-{10}<SUP>-2</SUP>{M}<SUB>\\oplus </SUB>.

The water ice absorption in PDS 453 shows a possible variation of the feature among the six observing epochs. This variation could be due to a change of absorption materials passing through our line of sight to the central star.

Recently, several groups identified RWBL candidates, mostly found while searching for low-energy counterparts of the unidentified or unassociated gamma-ray sources listed in the Fermi catalogs. Confirming RWBLs is a challenging task since they could be confused with white dwarfs (WDs) or weak emission line quasars (WELQs) when there are not sufficient data to precisely draw their broadband spectral energy distribution, and their classification is mainly based on a featureless optical spectra. Motivated by the recent discovery that Fermi BL Lacs appear to have very peculiar mid-IR emission, we show that it is possible to distinguish between WDs, WELQs, and BL Lacs using the [3.4]-[4.6]-[12] μm color-color plot built using the WISE magnitudes when the optical spectrum is available. On the basis of this analysis, we identify WISE J064459.38+603131 and WISE J141046.00+740511.2 as the first two genuine RWBLs, both potentially associated with Fermi sources. Finally, to strengthen our identification of these objects as true RWBLs, we present multifrequency observations for these two candidates to show that their spectral behavior is indeed consistent with that of the BL Lac population.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922053","page":["113"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..113M","bibgroup":["CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Massaro, F.","Marchesini, E.

W.","abstract":"The ultra-faint satellite galaxy Hercules has a strongly elongated and irregular morphology with detections of tidal features up to 1.3 deg (3 kpc) from its center. This suggests that Hercules may be dissolving under the Milky Way’s gravitational influence, and hence could be a tidal stream in formation rather than a bound, dark-matter-dominated satellite. Using Bayesian inference in combination with N-body simulations, we show that Hercules has to be on a very eccentric orbit (∊ ≈ 0.95) within the Milky Way in this scenario. On such an orbit, Hercules “explodes” as a consequence of the last tidal shock at pericenter 0.5 Gyr ago. It is currently decelerating toward the apocenter of its orbit with a velocity of V = 157 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>—of which 99% is directed radially outwards. Due to differential orbital plane precession caused by the non-spherical nature of the Galactic potential, its debris fans out nearly perpendicular to its orbit. This explains why Hercules has an elongated shape without showing a distance gradient along its main body: it is in fact a stream that is significantly broader than it is long. In other words, it is moving perpendicular to its apparent major axis. In this scenario, there is a spike in the radial velocity profile created by the dominant debris component that formed through the last pericenter passage. This is similar to kinematic substructure that is observed in the real Hercules. Modeling a satellite on such a highly eccentric orbit is strongly dependent on the form of the Galactic potential. We therefore propose that detailed kinematic investigation of Hercules and other exploding satellite candidates can yield strong constraints on the potential of the Milky Way.","read_count":48,"citation_count":10,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921926","page":["112"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..112K","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Küpper, Andreas H.

We re-calibrate the r-band light curves for ̃28,000 luminous, broad-line active galactic nuclei from the SDSS, producing a total of ̃2.4 million photometric data points. We utilize both the structure function (SF) and power spectrum density (PSD) formalisms to search for links between the optical variability and the physical parameters of the accreting supermassive black holes that power the quasars. The excess variance (SF<SUP>2</SUP>) of the quasar sample tends to zero at very short time separations, validating our re-calibration of the time-series data. We find that the the amplitude of variability at a given time-interval, or equivalently the timescale of variability to reach a certain amplitude, is most strongly correlated with luminosity with weak or no dependence on black hole mass and redshift. For a variability level of SF(τ) = 0.07 mag, the timescale has a dependency of τ \\propto {L}<SUP>0.4</SUP>. This is broadly consistent with the expectation from a simple Keplerian accretion disk model, which provides τ \\propto {L}<SUP>0.5</SUP>. The PSD analysis also reveals that many quasar light curves are steeper than a damped random walk. We find a correlation between the steepness of the PSD slopes, specifically the fraction of slopes steeper than 2.5, and black hole mass, although we cannot exclude the possibility that luminosity or Eddington ratio are the drivers of this effect. This effect is also seen in the SF analysis of the (I)PTF data, and in a PSD analysis of quasars in the SDSS Stripe 82.","read_count":53,"citation_count":9,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922003","page":["111"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..111C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Caplar, Neven","Lilly, Simon J.","Trakhtenbrot, Benny"],"aff":["Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 27, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland","Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 27, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland","Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, ETH Zurich, Wolfgang-Pauli-Strasse 27, 8093, Zurich, Switzerland"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-3287-5250","0000-0002-6423-3597","0000-0002-3683-7297"],"issue":"2","orcid_other":["0000-0003-3287-5250","-","-"],"volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/111"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["NED:4","SIMBAD:2"],"keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","black hole physics","methods: data analysis","quasars: general","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe are very grateful to Shri Kulkarni and the PTF and iPTF collaborations for their generous granting of access to their photometric database.

Our sample of 45 stellar systems includes 28 kinematically confirmed dark-matter-dominated dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and 17 recently discovered systems that have photometric characteristics consistent with the population of known dSphs. For each of these targets, the relative predicted γ-ray flux due to dark matter annihilation is taken from kinematic analysis if available, and estimated from a distance-based scaling relation otherwise, assuming that the stellar systems are DM-dominated dSphs. LAT data coincident with four of the newly discovered targets show a slight preference (each ̃ 2σ local) for γ-ray emission in excess of the background. However, the ensemble of derived γ-ray flux upper limits for individual targets is consistent with the expectation from analyzing random blank-sky regions, and a combined analysis of the population of stellar systems yields no globally significant excess (global significance < 1σ ). Our analysis has increased sensitivity compared to the analysis of 15 confirmed dSphs by Ackermann et al.

We have 130 ETGs from the Hubble Space Telescope Cluster Supernova Survey for z ̃ 1 and 355 ETGs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for z ̃ 0. We have developed an isophote shape analysis method, which can be used for high-redshift galaxies and has been carefully compared with published results. We have applied the same method for both the z ̃ 1 and 0 samples. We find similar dependence of the a<SUB>4</SUB> parameter on the mass and size at z ̃ 1 and 0; the main population of ETGs changes from disky to boxy at a critical stellar mass of {log}({M}<SUB>* </SUB>/{M}<SUB>☉ </SUB>)̃ 11.5 with the massive end dominated by boxy. The disky ETG fraction decreases with increasing stellar mass both at z ̃ 1 and 0, and is consistent between these redshifts in all stellar mass bins when the Eddington bias is taken into account. Although uncertainties are large, the results suggest that the isophote shapes and probably dynamical properties of ETGs in massive clusters are already in place at z > 1 and do not significantly evolve in z < 1, despite significant size evolution in the same galaxy population. The constant disky fraction favors less violent processes than mergers as the main cause of the size and morphological evolution of intermediate mass ETGs in z < 1.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922072","page":["109"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..109M","bibgroup":["Subaru","ESO/Telescopes","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mitsuda, Kazuma","Doi, Mamoru","Morokuma, Tomoki","Suzuki, Nao","Yasuda, Naoki","Perlmutter, Saul","Aldering, Greg","Meyers, Joshua"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan; Institute of Astronomy, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0015, Japan;","Institute of Astronomy, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0015, Japan;  Kavli IPMU (WPI), UTIAS, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8583, Japan; Research Center for the Early universe, the University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan","Institute of Astronomy, School of Science, The University of Tokyo, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-0015, Japan;  Kavli IPMU (WPI), UTIAS, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8583, Japan","Kavli IPMU (WPI), UTIAS, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8583, Japan","Kavli IPMU (WPI), UTIAS, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, Chiba 277-8583, Japan","Department of Physics, University of California Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA;  E.O.

Motivated by recent measurements of starspot lifetimes, we investigate the disintegration of a magnetic flux tube by nonlinear diffusion. Previous theoretical studies are extended by considering two physically motivated functional forms for the nonlinear diffusion coefficient D: an inverse power-law dependence D ∝ B<SUP>-ν</SUP> and a step-function dependence of D on the magnetic field magnitude B. Analytical self-similar solutions are presented for the power-law case, including solutions exhibiting “superfast” diffusion. For the step-function case, the heat-balance integral method yields approximate solutions, valid for moderately suppressed diffusion in the spot. The accuracy of the resulting solutions is confirmed numerically, using a method which provides an accurate description of long-time evolution by imposing boundary conditions at infinite distance from the spot. The new models may allow insight into the differences and similarities between sunspots and starspots.","read_count":17,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922057","page":["108"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..108L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Litvinenko, Yuri E.","Wheatland, M.

The light curve showed two distinct peaks with absolute magnitudes {M}<SUB>r</SUB>≤slant -12.4 and {M}<SUB>r</SUB>≃ -12, on 2014 November 11 and 2015 February 17, respectively.

From archival data spanning 15-8 years before the outburst, we find a single source consistent with the optically discovered transient, which we attribute to being the progenitor; it has properties consistent with being an F-type yellow supergiant with L ̃ 8.7 × {10}<SUP>4</SUP> L<SUB>☉</SUB>, {T}<SUB>{eff</SUB>}≈ 7000 K, and an estimated mass of {{M}}1=18+/- 1 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. This star has likely just finished the H-burning phase in the core, started expanding, and is now crossing the Hertzsprung gap. Based on the combination of observed properties, we argue that the progenitor is a binary system, with the more evolved system overfilling the Roche lobe. Comparison with binary evolution models suggests that the outburst was an extremely rare phenomenon, likely associated with the ejection of the common envelope of a massive star.

The survey has searched for pulsations in 118 unidentified pulsar-like sources, requiring about 10,000 years of CPU core time. In total, this survey has resulted in the discovery of 17 new gamma-ray pulsars, of which 13 are newly reported in this work, and an accompanying paper. These pulsars are all young, isolated pulsars with characteristic ages between 12 kyr and 2 Myr, and spin-down powers between 10<SUP>34</SUP> and 4 × 10<SUP>36</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Two of these are the slowest spinning gamma-ray pulsars yet known. One pulsar experienced a very large glitch {{∆ }}f/f≈ 3.5× {10}<SUP>-6</SUP> during the Fermi mission. In this, the first of two associated papers, we describe the search scheme used in this survey, and estimate the sensitivity of our search to pulsations in unidentified Fermi-LAT sources. One such estimate results in an upper limit of 57% for the fraction of pulsed emission from the gamma-ray source associated with the Cas A supernova remnant, constraining the pulsed gamma-ray photon flux that can be produced by the neutron star at its center. We also present the results of precise timing analyses for each of the newly detected pulsars.","read_count":160,"citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922085","page":["106"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..106C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Clark, C.

This sample includes an updated analysis of seven clusters from our previous publications and results for five new clusters that expand the metallicity range over which our technique has been tested. We find that the [Fe/H] measured from IL spectra agrees to ̃0.1 dex for GCs with metallicities as high as [Fe/H] = -0.3, but the abundances measured for more metal-rich clusters may be underestimated. In addition we systematically evaluate the accuracy of abundance ratios, [X/Fe], for Na I, Mg I, Al I, Si I, Ca I, Ti I, Ti II, Sc II, V I, Cr I, Mn I, Co I, Ni I, Cu I, Y II, Zr I, Ba II, La II, Nd II, and Eu II. The elements for which the IL analysis gives results that are most similar to analysis of individual stellar spectra are Fe I, Ca I, Si I, Ni I, and Ba II. The elements that show the greatest differences include Mg I and Zr I. Some elements show good agreement only over a limited range in metallicity. More stellar abundance data in these clusters would enable more complete evaluation of the IL results for other important elements.

From 2015 July 11-August 5, we monitored V404 Cygni with Chandra, Swift, and NuSTAR in the X-ray, and with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and the Very Long Baseline Array in the radio, spanning a range of luminosities that were poorly covered during its previous outburst in 1989 (our 2015 campaign covers 2× {10}<SUP>33</SUP>≲ {L}<SUB>{{X</SUB>}}≲ {10}<SUP>34</SUP> {erg} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>). During our 2015 campaign, the X-ray spectrum evolved rapidly from a hard photon index of {{Γ }}≈ 1.6 (at {L}<SUB>{{X</SUB>}}≈ {10}<SUP>34</SUP> {erg} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>) to a softer {{Γ }}≈ 2 (at {L}<SUB>{{X</SUB>}}≈ 3× {10}<SUP>33</SUP> {erg} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>). We argue that V404 Cygni reaching {{Γ }}≈ 2 marks the beginning of the quiescent spectral state, which occurs at a factor of ≈3-4 higher X-ray luminosity than the average pre-outburst luminosity of ≈ 8× {10}<SUP>32</SUP> {erg} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>. V404 Cygni falls along the same radio/X-ray luminosity correlation that it followed during its previous outburst in 1989, implying a robust disk-jet coupling. We exclude the possibility that a synchrotron-cooled jet dominates the X-ray emission in quiescence, leaving synchrotron self-Compton from either a hot accretion flow or from a radiatively cooled jet as the most likely sources of X-ray radiation, and/or particle acceleration along the jet becoming less efficient in quiescence. Finally, we present the first indications of correlated radio and X-ray variability on minute timescales in quiescence, tentatively measuring the radio emission to lag the X-ray by 15+/- 4 minute, suggestive of X-ray variations propagating down a jet with a length of <3.0 au.","citation_count":12,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921930","page":["104"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..104P","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes","CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Plotkin, R.

The gas surrounding these galaxies is expected to contain energy from past episodes of active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback, and after using modeling to subtract undetected contaminants, we detect a tSZ signal at a significance of 0.9σ for our low-z galaxies and 1.8σ for our high-z galaxies. We then include data from the high-frequency Planck bands for a subset of 227 low-z galaxies and 529 high-z galaxies and find low-z and high-z tSZ detections of 1.0σ and 1.5σ , respectively.

Many mechanisms have been proposed to explain how energy is transferred to and deposited in the corona. We summarize past observational studies that attempted to identify the heating mechanism and point out the difficulties in reproducing the observations of the solar corona from the heating models. The aim of this paper is to study whether the observed extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emission in individual coronal loops in solar active regions can provide constraints on the volumetric heating function, and to develop a diagnostic for the heating function for a subset of loops that are found close to static thermal equilibrium. We reconstruct the coronal magnetic field from Solar Dynamics Observatory/HMI data using a nonlinear force-free magnetic field model. We model selected loops using a one-dimensional stationary model, with a heating rate dependent locally on the magnetic field strength along the loop, and we calculate the emission from these loops in various EUV wavelengths for different heating rates. We present a method to measure a power index β defining the dependence of the volumetric heating rate E<SUB>H</SUB> on the magnetic field, {E}<SUB>H</SUB>\\propto {B}<SUP>β </SUP>, and controlling also the shape of the heating function: concentrated near the loop top, uniform and concentrated near the footpoints. The diagnostic is based on the dependence of the electron density on the index β. This method is free from the assumptions of the loop filling factor but requires spectroscopic measurements of the density-sensitive lines. The range of applicability for loops of different length and heating distributions is discussed, and the steps to solving the coronal heating problem are outlined.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922062","page":["100"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834..100F","identifier":["2017ApJ...834..100F","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/100","10.3847/1538-4357/834/2/100"],"bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Fludra, A.","Hornsey, C.","Nakariakov, V.

The existence of these high-mass stars that apparently formed in the field challenges the generally accepted paradigm, which requires star formation to occur in clustered environments. In order to understand the physical conditions for the formation of these stars, it is necessary to observe isolated high-mass stars while they are still forming. With the Hubble Space Telescope, we observe the seven most isolated massive (>8 {M}<SUB>☉ </SUB>) young stellar objects (MYSOs) in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The observations show that while these MYSOs are remote from other MYSOs, OB associations, and even known giant molecular clouds, they are actually not isolated at all. Imaging reveals ̃100 to several hundred pre-main-sequence (PMS) stars in the vicinity of each MYSO. These previously undetected PMS stars form prominent compact clusters around the MYSOs, and in most cases they are also distributed sparsely across the observed regions. Contrary to what previous high-mass field star studies show, these observations suggest that high-mass stars may not be able to form in clusters with masses less than 100 {M}<SUB>☉ </SUB>. If these MYSOs are indeed the best candidates for isolated high-mass star formation, then the lack of isolation is at odds with random sampling of the initial mass function. Moreover, while isolated MYSOs may not exist, we find evidence that isolated clusters containing O stars can exist, which in itself is rare.","citation_count":9,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922030","page":["94"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...94S","bibgroup":["NRAO","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Stephens, Ian W.","Gouliermis, Dimitrios","Looney, Leslie W.","Gruendl, Robert A.","Chu, You-Hua","Weisz, Daniel R.","Seale, Jonathan P.","Chen, C. -H.

Rotation could be an important aspect of any model for SNe Ia, whether single or double degenerate, with the white dwarf mass at, below, or above the Chandrasekhar limit. Differential rotation is specifically invoked in attempts to account for the apparent excess mass in the super-Chandrasekhar events. Some earlier work has suggested that only uniform rotation is consistent with the expected mechanisms of angular momentum transport in white dwarfs, while others have found pronounced differential rotation. We show that if the baroclinic instability is active in degenerate matter and the effects of magnetic fields are neglected, both nearly uniform rotation and strongly differential rotation are possible. We classify rotation regimes in terms of the Richardson number, Ri. At small values of Ri ≤slant 0.1, we find both the low-viscosity Zahn regime with a nonmonotonic angular velocity profile and a new differential rotation regime for which the viscosity is high and scales linearly with the shear, σ. Employment of Kelvin-Helmholtz viscosity alone yields differential rotation. Large values of Ri ≫ 1 produce a regime of nearly uniform rotation for which the baroclinic viscosity is of intermediate value and scales as {σ }<SUP>3</SUP>. We discuss the gap in understanding of the behavior at intermediate values of Ri and how observations may constrain the rotation regimes attained by nature.","read_count":25,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922069","page":["93"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...93G","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Ghosh, Pranab","Wheeler, J.

The gamma-ray emissivity of a cloud of known column density is then a measure of the impinging CR population and may be used to map the k-scale CR distribution in the Galaxy.

These observations are used to show how differently electrons and protons responded to the quiet modulation conditions that prevailed from 2006 to 2009. It is well known that particle drifts, as one of four major mechanisms for the solar modulation of CRs, cause charge-sign-dependent solar modulation. Periods of minimum solar activity provide optimal conditions in which to study these drift effects. The observed behavior is compared to the solutions of a three-dimensional model for CRs in the heliosphere, including drifts. The numerical results confirm that the difference in the evolution of electron and proton spectra during the last prolonged solar minimum is attributed to a large extent to particle drifts.

The variation of the accretion rates and flow geometry that change on a daily basis during each of the outbursts can be very well understood using the recent implementation of the two-component advective flow solution of the viscous transonic flow equations as an additive table model in XSPEC. This has dramatically improved our understanding of accretion flow dynamics. Most interestingly, the solution allows us to treat the mass of the BHC as a free parameter and its mass could be estimated from spectral fits. In this paper, we fitted the data of two successive outbursts of H 1743-322 in 2010 and 2011 and studied the evolution of accretion flow parameters, such as two-component (Keplerian and sub-Keplerian) accretion rates, shock location (I.e., size of the Compton cloud), etc. We assume that the model normalization remains the same across the states in both these outbursts.

These signals are weaker than those detected in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and are consistent with galactic conformity being the result of large-scale tidal fields and reflecting assembly bias. We also measure the star-forming fraction of central galaxies at fixed stellar mass as a function of large-scale environment and find that central galaxies are more likely to be quenched in overdense environments, independent of stellar mass. However, we find that environment does not affect the star formation efficiency of central galaxies, as long as they are forming stars. We test for redshift and stellar mass dependence of the conformity signal within our sample and show that large volumes and multiple fields are required at intermediate redshift to adequately account for cosmic variance.","citation_count":13,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921996","page":["87"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...87B","bibgroup":["CfA","Spitzer","CFHT"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Berti, Angela M.","Coil, Alison L.","Behroozi, Peter S.","Eisenstein, Daniel J.","Bray, Aaron D.","Cool, Richard J.","Moustakas, John"],"aff":["Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences, Department of Physics, University of California, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, San Diego, CA 92093, USA","Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences, Department of Physics, University of California, 9500 Gilman Drive, La Jolla, San Diego, CA 92093, USA","Department of Astronomy, University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA;","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","MMT Observatory, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA","Department of Physics and Astronomy, Siena College, 515 Loudon Road, Loudonville, NY 12211, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-3582-6649","0000-0002-2583-5894","-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/87"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:2"],"keyword":["galaxies: evolution","galaxies: statistics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe gratefully acknowledge Andrew Hearin for thoughtful feedback on a draft of this paper.

This “classic” three-part configuration consists of a bright leading edge, a dark circular- or teardrop-shaped cavity, and a bright core within the cavity. It is generally accepted that these are manifestations of coronal plasma pileup, the driving magnetic flux rope, and the associated eruptive filament, respectively. The latter has become accepted by the community since coronagraph CMEs have been commonly associated with eruptive filaments for over 40 years. In this second part of our series challenging views on CMEs, we present the case that the inner core of the three-part coronagraph CME may not be, and in the most common cases is not, a filament. We present our case in the form of four exhibits showing that most of the CMEs in a broad survey are not associated with an eruptive filament at the Sun, and that the cores of those CMEs that are filament-associated do not geometrically resemble or consist of material from the associated filament. We conclude with a discussion on the possible causes of the bright CME core and what happens to the filament material postlaunch. We discuss how the CME core could arise spontaneously from the eruption of a flux rope from the Sun, or could be the result of a mathematical caustic produced by the geometric projection of a twisted flux rope.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922084","page":["86"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...86H","identifier":["2017ApJ...834...86H","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/86","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/86"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Howard, T.

Although the mechanisms by which fully convective stars generate large-scale magnetic fields are not well understood, it is clear that, as for solar-type stars, stellar rotation plays a pivotal role. We present 270 new optical spectra of low-mass stars in the Solar Neighborhood. Combining our observations with those from the literature, our sample comprises 2202 measurements or non-detections of Hα emission in nearby M dwarfs. This includes 466 with photometric rotation periods. Stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.6 M<SUB>☉</SUB> are well-represented in our sample, with fast and slow rotators of all masses. We observe a threshold in the mass-period plane that separates active and inactive M dwarfs. The threshold coincides with the fast-period edge of the slowly rotating population, at approximately the rotation period at which an era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease. The well-defined active/inactive boundary indicates that Hα activity is a useful diagnostic for stellar rotation period, e.g., for target selection for exoplanet surveys, and we present a mass-period relation for inactive M dwarfs. We also find a significant, moderate correlation between L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB> and variability amplitude: more active stars display higher levels of photometric variability. Consistent with previous work, our data show that rapid rotators maintain a saturated value of L<SUB>Hα</SUB>/L<SUB>bol</SUB>.

To boost the chance of successfully observing such counterparts, we have developed an algorithm that optimizes the number of observing fields and their corresponding time allocations by maximizing the detection probability. As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we optimize follow-up observations targeting kilonovae using telescopes including the CTIO-Dark Energy Camera, Subaru-HyperSuprimeCam, Pan-STARRS, and the Palomar Transient Factory. We consider three simulated gravitational wave events with 90% credible error regions spanning areas from ̃ 30 {\\deg }<SUP>2</SUP> to ̃ 300 {\\deg }<SUP>2</SUP>. Assuming a source at 200 {Mpc}, we demonstrate that to obtain a maximum detection probability, there is an optimized number of fields for any particular event that a telescope should observe. To inform future telescope design studies, we present the maximum detection probability and corresponding number of observing fields for a combination of limiting magnitudes and fields of view over a range of parameters. We show that for large gravitational wave error regions, telescope sensitivity rather than field of view is the dominating factor in maximizing the detection probability.","read_count":30,"citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922056","page":["84"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...84C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Chan, Man Leong","Hu, Yi-Ming","Messenger, Chris","Hendry, Martin","Heng, Ik Siong"],"aff":["SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK","TianQin Research Center for Gravitational Physics, Sun Yat-sen University, SYSU Zhuhai Campus, 519082 Zhuhai, Guangdong, China; Max Planck Institute for Gravitational Physics (Albert Einstein Institute), Callinstraße 38, D-30167 Hannover, Germany; Tsinghua University, Beijing, China","SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK","SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK","SUPA, School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, Glasgow G12 8QQ, UK"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-7869-0174","-","-","0000-0002-1977-0019"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/84"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["gravitational waves","methods: observational","stars: neutron","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank our colleague Xilong Fan, who provided insight and expertise that greatly assisted the research.

In this picture, overdensities of galaxies are expected around high-redshift quasars. However, observations based on the detection of Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) around these quasars do not offer a clear picture: this may be due to the uncertain redshift constraints of LBGs, which are solely selected through broadband filters. To circumvent such uncertainties, we here perform a search for Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) in the field of the quasar PSO J215.1512-16.0417 at z ̃ 5.73, through narrowband deep imaging with FORS2 at the Very Large Telescope. We study an area of 37 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP>, I.e., ̃206 comoving Mpc<SUP>2</SUP> at the redshift of the quasar. We find no evidence of an overdensity of LAEs in the quasar field with respect to blank-field studies. Possible explanations for these findings may be that our survey volume is too small, or that the strong ionizing radiation from the quasar hinders galaxy formation in its immediate proximity. Another possibility is that these quasars are not situated in the dense environments predicted by some simulations.","citation_count":12,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922071","page":["83"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...83M","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mazzucchelli, C.","Bañados, E.","Decarli, R.","Farina, E.

We select a sample of 418 bright and extended galaxies at z = 3.5-6.5 from a parent sample of ̃8000 photometric-redshift-selected galaxies from Finkelstein et al. We first examine galaxies at 3.5 ≲ z ≲ 4.0 using additional deep K-band survey data from the HAWK-I UDS and GOODS Survey which covers the 4000 Å break at these redshifts. We measure the stellar mass, star formation rate, and dust extinction for galaxy inner and outer regions via spatially resolved spectral energy distribution fitting based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm. By comparing specific star formation rates (sSFRs) between inner and outer parts of the galaxies we find that the majority of galaxies with high central mass densities show evidence for a preferentially lower sSFR in their centers than in their outer regions, indicative of reduced sSFRs in their central regions. We also study galaxies at z ̃ 5 and 6 (here limited to high spatial resolution in the rest-frame ultraviolet only), finding that they show sSFRs which are generally independent of radial distance from the center of the galaxies. This indicates that stars are formed uniformly at all radii in massive galaxies at z ̃ 5-6, contrary to massive galaxies at z ≲ 4.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922039","page":["81"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...81J","bibgroup":["Spitzer","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Jung, Intae","Finkelstein, Steven L.","Song, Mimi","Dickinson, Mark","Dekel, Avishai","Ferguson, Henry C.","Fontana, Adriano","Koekemoer, Anton M.","Lu, Yu","Mobasher, Bahram","Papovich, Casey","Ryan, Russell E., Jr.","Salmon, Brett","Straughn, Amber N."],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA","Department of Astronomy, The University of Texas at Austin, Austin, TX 78712, USA","Astrophysics Science Division, Goddard Space Flight Center, Code 665, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA","National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Tucson, AZ 85719, USA","Center for Astrophysics and Planetary Science, Racah Institute of Physics, The Hebrew University, Jerusalem 91904, Israel","Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Drive, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA","INAF—Osservatorio Astronomico di Roma, via di Frascati 33, I-00040, Monte Porzio Catone, Italy","Space Telescope Science Institute, 3700 San Martin Drive, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA","The Observatories, The Carnegie Institution for Science, 813 Santa Barbara Street, Pasadena, CA 91101, USA","Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of California, Riverside, CA 92521, USA","George P. and Cynthia W.

Some previous studies have suggested that magnetic fields of active regions in the solar chromosphere are close to being force-free whereas there is no consistency among previous studies on whether magnetic fields of active regions in the solar photosphere are force-free or not. Here we use three kinds of representative magnetic fields (analytical force-free solutions, modeled solar-like force-free fields, and observed non-force-free fields) to discuss how measurement issues such as limited field of view (FOV), instrument sensitivity, and measurement error could affect the estimation of force-freeness based on observed magnetograms. Unlike previous studies that focus on discussing the effect of limited FOV or instrument sensitivity, our calculation shows that just measurement error alone can significantly influence the results of estimates of force-freeness, due to the fact that measurement errors in horizontal magnetic fields are usually ten times larger than those in vertical fields. This property of measurement errors, interacting with the particular form of a formula for estimating force-freeness, would result in wrong judgments of the force-freeness: a truly force-free field may be mistakenly estimated as being non-force-free and a truly non-force-free field may be estimated as being force-free. Our analysis calls for caution when interpreting estimates of force-freeness based on measured magnetograms, and also suggests that the true photospheric magnetic field may be further away from being force-free than it currently appears to be.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921920","page":["80"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...80Z","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zhang, X.

At first, two neighboring mini-prominences arose in turn from the low solar atmosphere and collided with a loop-like system over them. The collisions between the loop-like system and the mini-prominences lead to the blowout, and then a cusp-shaped jet formed with a spire and an arch-base. In the spire, many brightening blobs originating from the junction between the spire and the arch-base moved upward in a rotating manner and then in a straight line in the late phase of the jet. In the arch-base, dark and bright material simultaneously tracked in a fan-like structure, and the majority of the material moved along the fan's threads. At the later phase of the jet's evolution, bidirectional flows emptied the arch-base, while downflows emptied the spire, thus making the jet entirely vanish. The extremely detailed observations in this study shed new light on how magnetic reconnection alters the inner topological structure of a jet and provides a beneficial complement for understanding current jet models.","citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922001","page":["79"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...79Z","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zhang, Yuzong","Zhang, Jun"],"aff":["Key Laboratory of Solar Activity, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100012, China","Key Laboratory of Solar Activity, National Astronomical Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100012, China"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-2869-0651","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/79"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: chromosphere","Sun: corona","Sun: filaments","prominences","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nIRIS is a NASA Small Explorer mission developed and operated by LMSAL with mission operations executed at NASA ARC and major contributions to downlink communications funded by the NSC (Norway).

Using complementary optical imaging from the Hubble Space Telescope, we identify the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) in the 3.6 μm photometry, separating thermally pulsating asymptotic giant branch stars from the larger red giant branch populations. Unlike the constant TRGB in the I band, at 3.6 μm, the TRGB magnitude varies by ̃0.7 mag, making it unreliable as a distance indicator. The intermediate-age and old stars are well mixed in two-thirds of the sample, with no evidence of a gradient in the ratio of the intermediate-age to old stellar populations outside the central ̃1′-2′. Variable AGB stars are detected in the outer extremities of the galaxies, indicating that chemical enrichment from these dust-producing stars may occur in the outer regions of galaxies with some frequency. Theories of structure formation in dwarf galaxies must account for the lack of radial gradients in intermediate-age populations and the presence of these stars in the outer extremities of dwarfs. Finally, we identify unique features in individual galaxies, such as extended tidal features in Sex A and Sag DIG and a central concentration of AGB stars in the inner regions of NGC 185 and NGC 147.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921928","page":["78"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...78M","bibgroup":["Spitzer","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["McQuinn, Kristen B.

Based on the singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) model of the SGL system, we obtain that the constrained curvature parameter {{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{k</SUB>}} is close to zero from the SGL data, which is consistent with the latest result of Planck measurement. More interestingly, we find that the parameter f in the SIE model is strongly correlated with the curvature {{{Ω }}}<SUB>{{k</SUB>}}. Neglecting this correlation in the analysis will significantly overestimate the constraining power of SGL data on the curvature. Furthermore, the obtained constraint on f is different from previous results: f=1.105+/- 0.030 (68% confidence level [C.L.]), which means that the standard singular isothermal sphere (SIS) model (f = 1) is disfavored by the current SGL data at more than a 3σ C.L. We also divide all of the SGL data into two parts according to the centric stellar velocity dispersion {σ }<SUB>{{c</SUB>}} and find that the larger the value of {σ }<SUB>{{c</SUB>}} for the subsample, the more favored the standard SIS model is.

The interstellar medium of NGC 1404 is characterized by a sharp leading edge, 8 kpc from the Galaxy center, and a short downstream gaseous tail. Contact discontinuities are resolved on unprecedented spatial scales (0.″5 = 45 pc) due to the combination of the proximity of NGC 1404, the superb spatial resolution of Chandra, and the very deep (670 ks) exposure. At the leading edge, we observe sub-kiloparsec-scale eddies generated by Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) and put an upper limit of 5% Spitzer on the isotropic viscosity of the hot cluster plasma. We also observe mixing between the hot cluster gas and the cooler galaxy gas in the downstream stripped tail, which provides further evidence of a low viscosity plasma. The assumed ordered magnetic fields in the ICM ought to be smaller than 5 μG to allow KHI to develop. The lack of an evident magnetic draping layer just outside the contact edge is consistent with such an upper limit.","citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922097","page":["74"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...74S","bibgroup":["CXC","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Su, Yuanyuan","Kraft, Ralph P.","Roediger, Elke","Nulsen, Paul","Forman, William R.","Churazov, Eugene","Randall, Scott W.","Jones, Christine","Machacek, Marie E."],"aff":["Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","E.A.

We analyzed 73,116 early-type galaxies at 0.1 ≤ z < 0.15, adopting a robust nonparametric size measurement technique and extending the analysis to many massive galaxies.

Following discovery with the Arecibo Telescope, extended observations of these pulsars over several years at Jodrell Bank Observatory have revealed the details of their rotation and radiation properties. PSRs J1910+0517 and J1929+1357 show long-term extreme bimodal intermittency, switching between active (ON) and inactive (OFF) emission states and indicating the presence of a large, hitherto unrecognized underlying population of such objects. For PSR J1929+1357, the initial duty cycle was f<SUB>ON</SUB> = 0.008, but two years later, this changed quite abruptly to f<SUB>ON</SUB> = 0.16. This is the first time that a significant evolution in the activity of an intermittent pulsar has been seen, and we show that the spin-down rate of the pulsar is proportional to the activity. The spin-down rate of PSR J1929+1357 is increased by a factor of 1.8 when it is in active mode, similar to the increase seen in the other three known long-term intermittent pulsars. These discoveries increase the number of known pulsars displaying long-term intermittency to five. These five objects display a remarkably narrow range of spin-down power (\\dot{E} ̃ {10}<SUP>32</SUP> {erg} {{{s}}}<SUP>-1</SUP>) and accelerating potential above their polar caps.

Based on the revised X-ray position we have identified a new near-infrared (NIR) counterpart to GX 9+1 in K<SUB>s</SUB>-band images obtained with the PANIC and FourStar cameras on the Magellan Baade Telescope. NIR spectra of this {K}<SUB>s</SUB>=16.5+/- 0.1 mag star, taken with the FIRE spectrograph on the Baade Telescope, show a strong Br γ emission line, which is a clear signature that we discovered the true NIR counterpart to GX 9+1. The mass donor in GX 9+1 cannot be a late-type giant, as such a star would be brighter than the estimated absolute K<SUB>s</SUB> magnitude of the NIR counterpart. The slope of the dereddened NIR spectrum is poorly constrained due to uncertainties in the column density N<SUB>H</SUB> and NIR extinction. Considering the source’s distance and X-ray luminosity, we argue that N<SUB>H</SUB> likely lies near the high end of the previously suggested range. If this is indeed the case, the NIR spectrum is consistent with thermal emission from a heated accretion disk, possibly with a contribution from the secondary. In this respect, GX 9+1 is similar to other bright atolls and the Z sources, whose NIR spectra do not show the slope that is expected for a dominant contribution from optically thin synchrotron emission from the inner regions of a jet.

These maps were constructed from spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs) derived from optical Hubble Space Telescope imaging of resolved stars, taken as part of the Panchromatic Hubble Andromeda Treasury program. We use stellar population synthesis modeling to generate synthetic UV maps with a spatial resolution of ̃100 pc (̃24 arcsec), projected. When reddening is included, these maps reproduce all of the main morphological features in the GALEX imaging, including rings and large star-forming complexes. The predicted UV flux also agrees well with the observed flux, with median ratios between the modeled and observed flux of {{log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({f}<SUB>{FUV</SUB>}<SUP>{syn</SUP>}/{f}<SUB>{FUV</SUB>}<SUP>{obs</SUP>})=0.03+/- 0.24 and {{log}}<SUB>10</SUB>({f}<SUB>{NUV</SUB>}<SUP>{syn</SUP>}/{f}<SUB>{NUV</SUB>}<SUP>{obs</SUP>})=-0.03+/- 0.16 in the {FUV} and {NUV}, respectively. This agreement is particularly impressive given that we used only optical photometry to construct these UV maps. Having verified the synthetic reddened maps, we use the dust-free maps to examine properties of obscured flux and star formation. We compare our dust-free and reddened maps of {FUV} flux with the observed GALEX {FUV} flux and {FUV} + 24 μm flux to examine the fraction of obscured flux. We find that the maps of synthetic flux require that ̃90% of the {FUV} flux in M31 is obscured by dust, while the GALEX -based methods suggest that ̃70% of the {FUV} flux is absorbed by dust. This 30% increase in the estimate of the obscured flux is driven by significant differences between the dust-free synthetic {FUV} flux and that derived when correcting the observed {FUV} flux for dust absorption with 24 μm emission observations. The difference is further illustrated when we compare the SFRs derived from the {FUV} + 24 μm flux with the 100 Myr average SFR from the CMD-based SFHs. We find that the 24 μm corrected {FUV} flux underestimates the SFR by a factor of 2.3-2.5, depending on the chosen calibration. This discrepancy could be reduced by allowing for variability in the weight applied to the 24 μm data, as has been recently suggested in the literature.

Cluster particles grow in mass over several million years at the rate determined by local gas properties, with high time resolution. The particle growth is terminated by its own energy and momentum feedback on the interstellar medium. We test this implementation for Milky Way-sized galaxies at high redshift by comparing the properties of model clusters with observations of young star clusters. We find that the cluster initial mass function is best described by a Schechter function rather than a single power law. In agreement with observations, at low masses the logarithmic slope is α ≈ 1.8{--}2, while the cutoff at high mass scales with the star formation rate (SFR). A related trend is a positive correlation between the surface density of the SFR and fraction of stars contained in massive clusters. Both trends indicate that the formation of massive star clusters is preferred during bursts of star formation. These bursts are often associated with major-merger events. We also find that the median timescale for cluster formation ranges from 0.5 to 4 Myr and decreases systematically with increasing star formation efficiency. Local variations in the gas density and cluster accretion rate naturally lead to the scatter of the overall formation efficiency by an order of magnitude, even when the instantaneous efficiency is kept constant. Comparison of the formation timescale with the observed age spread of young star clusters provides an additional important constraint on the modeling of star formation and feedback schemes.","read_count":90,"citation_count":13,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922079","page":["69"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...69L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Li, Hui","Gnedin, Oleg Y.","Gnedin, Nickolay Y.","Meng, Xi","Semenov, Vadim A.","Kravtsov, Andrey V."],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA","Department of Astronomy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA","Particle Astrophysics Center, Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, IL 60510, USA;  Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA;  Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA","Department of Astronomy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA; Department of Astronomy, Peking University, 100871, Beijing, China","Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA; Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA","Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA; Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA; Enrico Fermi Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-1253-2763","-","-","-","0000-0002-6648-7136","0000-0003-4307-634X"],"issue":"1","orcid_other":["0000-0002-1253-2763","0000-0001-9852-9954","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/69"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:2"],"keyword":["cosmology: theory","galaxies: formation","galaxies: star clusters: general","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe simulations used in this work have been performed on the Joint Fermilab-KICP cluster “Fulla” at Fermilab.

We systematically vary “standard” assumptions made by numerical simulations related to, e.g., BH formation, stellar winds, binary properties of high-mass stars, and IMF within existing uncertainties, and study the effects on the evolution of the structural properties of GCs, and the BHs in GCs. We find that variations in initial assumptions can set otherwise identical initial clusters on completely different evolutionary paths, significantly affecting their present observable properties, or even affecting the cluster’s very survival to the present. However, these changes usually do not affect the numbers or properties of local BH-BH mergers. The only exception is that variations in the assumed winds and IMF can change the masses and numbers of local BH-BH mergers, respectively. All other variations (e.g., in initial binary properties and binary fraction) leave the masses and numbers of locally merging BH-BH binaries largely unchanged. This is in contrast to binary population synthesis models for the field, where results are very sensitive to many uncertain parameters in the initial binary properties and binary stellar-evolution physics. Weak winds are required for producing GW150914-like mergers from GCs at low redshifts. LVT151012 can be produced in GCs modeled both with strong and weak winds. GW151226 is lower-mass than typical mergers from GCs modeled with weak winds, but is similar to mergers from GCs modeled with strong winds.","read_count":63,"citation_count":29,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922025","page":["68"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...68C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Chatterjee, Sourav","Rodriguez, Carl L.","Rasio, Frederic A."],"aff":["Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration & Research in Astrophysics (CIERA), Physics & Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60202, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration & Research in Astrophysics (CIERA), Physics & Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60202, USA;  MIT-Kavli Institute for Astrophysics and Space Research 77 Massachusetts Avenue, 37-664H, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA","Center for Interdisciplinary Exploration & Research in Astrophysics (CIERA), Physics & Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60202, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-3680-2684","-","-"],"orcid_user":["0000-0002-3680-2684","-","0000-0002-7132-418X"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/68"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["black hole physics","globular clusters: general","methods: numerical","methods: statistical","stars: black holes","stars: kinematics and dynamics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe are grateful to the anonymous referee for constructive comments.

As such, the survey is well suited for the study of galaxies’ outskirts, haloes, and low surface brightness features that arise from dynamical interactions within the cluster environment. We report the discovery of extremely faint (μ<SUB>g</SUB> > 25 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>) shells in three Virgo cluster early-type dwarf galaxies: VCC 1361, VCC 1447, and VCC 1668. Among them, VCC 1447 has an absolute magnitude M<SUB>g</SUB> = -11.71 mag and is the least massive galaxy with a shell system discovered to date. We present a detailed study of these low surface brightness features. We detect between three and four shells in each of our galaxies. Within the uncertainties, we find no evidence of a color difference between the galaxy main body and shell features. The observed arcs of the shells are located up to several effective radii of the galaxies. We further explore the origin of these low surface brightness features with the help of idealized numerical simulations. We find that a near equal mass merger is best able to reproduce the main properties of the shells, including their quite symmetric appearance and their alignment along the major axis of the galaxy. The simulations provide support for a formation scenario in which a recent merger, between two near-equal mass, gas-free dwarf galaxies, forms the observed shell systems.

These regions of AGN jets have generally been modeled by a conical outflow with a roughly constant opening angle and flow speed. Nonetheless, some works suggest that a parabolic geometry would be more appropriate to fit the high energy spectral distribution properties and it has been recently found that, at least in some nearby radio galaxies, the geometry of the innermost regions of the jet is parabolic. We compile here multi-frequency core sizes of archival data to investigate the typically unresolved upstream regions of the jet geometry of a sample of 56 radio-loud AGNs. Data combined from the sources considered here are not consistent with the classic picture of a conical jet starting in the vicinity of the super-massive black hole (SMBH), and may exclude a pure parabolic outflow solution, but rather suggest an intermediate solution with quasi-parabolic streams, which are frequently seen in numerical simulations. Inspection of the large opening angles near the SMBH and the range of the Lorentz factors derived from our results support our analyses. Our result suggests that the conical jet paradigm in AGNs needs to be re-examined by millimeter/sub-millimeter VLBI observations.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921947","page":["65"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...65A","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Algaba, J.

The midpoint between the original variables and their corresponding extended variables at every integration step is readjusted as the initial values of the original variables and their corresponding extended ones at the next step integration. The triple-product construction is apparently superior to the composition of two triple products in computational efficiency. Above all, the new midpoint permutations are more effective in restraining the equality of the original variables and their corresponding extended ones at each integration step than the existing sequent permutations of momenta and coordinates. As a result, our new construction shares the benefit of implicit symplectic integrators in the conservation of the second post-Newtonian Hamiltonian of spinning compact binaries. Especially for the chaotic case, it can work well, but the existing sequent permuted algorithm cannot. When dissipative effects from the gravitational radiation reaction are included, the new symplectic-like method has a secular drift in the energy error of the dissipative system for the orbits that are regular in the absence of radiation, as an implicit symplectic integrator does. In spite of this, it is superior to the same-order implicit symplectic integrator in accuracy and efficiency. The new method is particularly useful in discussing the long-term evolution of inseparable Hamiltonian problems.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921935","page":["64"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...64L","identifier":["2017ApJ...834...64L","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/64","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/64"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Luo, Junjie","Wu, Xin","Huang, Guoqing","Liu, Fuyao"],"aff":["Department of Physics & Institute of Astronomy, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China","Department of Physics & Institute of Astronomy, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China","Department of Physics & Institute of Astronomy, Nanchang University, Nanchang 330031, China","School of Fundamental Studies, Shanghai University of Engineering Science, Shanghai 201620, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/64"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["binaries: general","black hole physics","celestial mechanics","chaos","methods: numerical"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe authors are very grateful to a referee for comments and suggestions.

The embedded-bipole model for these jets posits that they are driven by explosive, fast reconnection between the stressed closed field of the embedded bipole and the open field of the surrounding coronal hole. Previous numerical studies in Cartesian geometry, assuming uniform ambient magnetic field and plasma while neglecting gravity and solar wind, demonstrated that the model is robust and can produce jet-like events in simple configurations. We have extended these investigations by including spherical geometry, gravity, and solar wind in a nonuniform, coronal hole-like ambient atmosphere. Our simulations confirm that the jet is initiated by the onset of a kink-like instability of the internal closed field, which induces a burst of reconnection between the closed and external open field, launching a helical jet. Our new results demonstrate that the jet propagation is sustained through the outer corona, in the form of a traveling nonlinear Alfvén wave front trailed by slower-moving plasma density enhancements that are compressed and accelerated by the wave. This finding agrees well with observations of white-light coronal-hole jets, and can explain microstreams and torsional Alfvén waves detected in situ in the solar wind. We also use our numerical results to deduce scaling relationships between properties of the coronal source region and the characteristics of the resulting jet, which can be tested against observations.","citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922150","page":["62"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...62K","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Karpen, J.

Hubble Space Telescope (HST) ACS/WFC images were taken ̃277 and ̃416 days after B-band maximum in the filters F475W, F606W, and F775W. Observations with HST WFC3/UVIS images at epochs ̃216 and ̃365 days are included for a more complete analysis. The images reveal the temporal evolution of at least two major light-echo components. The first one exhibits a filled ring structure with position-angle-dependent intensity. This radially extended, diffuse echo indicates the presence of an inhomogeneous interstellar dust cloud ranging from ̃100 to ̃500 pc in the foreground of the SN. The second echo component appears as an unresolved luminous quarter-circle arc centered on the SN. The wavelength dependence of scattering measured in different dust components suggests that the dust producing the luminous arc favors smaller grain sizes, while that causing the diffuse light echo may have sizes similar to those of the Milky Way dust. Smaller grains can produce an optical depth consistent with that along the supernova-Earth line of sight measured by previous studies around maximum light. Therefore, it is possible that the dust slab from which the luminous arc arises is also responsible for most of the extinction toward SN 2014J. The optical depths determined from the Milky Way-like dust in the scattering matters are lower than the optical depth produced by the dust slab.","citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922172","page":["60"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...60Y","bibgroup":["HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Yang, Yi","Wang, Lifan","Baade, Dietrich","Brown, Peter.

This is because, at high altitudes, open clusters are far from the disruptive effects of in-plane substructures, such as spiral arms, molecular clouds, and the bar. However, an important aspect to consider in this scenario is that orbits of high-altitude open clusters will eventually cross the Galactic plane, where the vertical tidal field of the disk is strong. In this work, we simulate the interaction of open clusters with the tidal field of a detailed Milky Way Galactic model at different average altitudes and galactocentric radii. We find that the life expectancy of clusters decreases as the maximum orbital altitude increases and reaches a minimum at altitudes of approximately 600 pc. Clusters near the Galactic plane live longer because they do not experience strong vertical tidal shocks from the Galactic disk; then, for orbital altitudes higher than 600 pc, clusters again start to live longer due to the decrease in the number of encounters with the disk. With our study, we find that the compressive nature of the tides in the arms region and the bar play an important role in the survival of small clusters by protecting them from disruption: clusters inside the arms can live up to twice as long as those outside the arms at similar galactocentric distances.","read_count":31,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922197","page":["58"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...58M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Martinez-Medina, L.

With the aim of understanding the magnetic properties that govern such flares and eruptions, we systematically survey all flare events with Geostationary Orbiting Environmental Satellite levels of ≥M5.0 within 45° from disk center between 2010 May and 2016 April. These criteria lead to a total of 51 flares from 29 ARs, for which we analyze the observational data obtained by the Solar Dynamics Observatory. More than 80% of the 29 ARs are found to exhibit δ-sunspots, and at least three ARs violate Hale’s polarity rule. The flare durations are approximately proportional to the distance between the two flare ribbons, to the total magnetic flux inside the ribbons, and to the ribbon area. From our study, one of the parameters that clearly determine whether a given flare event is CME-eruptive or not is the ribbon area normalized by the sunspot area, which may indicate that the structural relationship between the flaring region and the entire AR controls CME productivity. AR characterization shows that even X-class events do not require δ-sunspots or strong-field, high-gradient polarity inversion lines. An investigation of historical observational data suggests the possibility that the largest solar ARs, with magnetic flux of 2 × 10<SUP>23</SUP> Mx, might be able to produce “superflares” with energies of the order of 10<SUP>34</SUP> erg. The proportionality between the flare durations and magnetic energies is consistent with stellar flare observations, suggesting a common physical background for solar and stellar flares.","citation_count":11,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922194","page":["56"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...56T","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Toriumi, Shin","Schrijver, Carolus J.","Harra, Louise K.","Hudson, Hugh","Nagashima, Kaori"],"aff":["National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan","Lockheed Martin Advanced Technology Center, 3251 Hanover Street, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA","UCL-Mullard Space Science Laboratory, Holmbury St Mary, Dorking, Surrey, RH5 6NT, UK","SUPA School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Glasgow, UK","Max-Planck-Institut für Sonnensystemforschung, Justus-von-Liebig-Weg 3, D-37077 Göttingen, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-1276-2403","0000-0002-6010-8182","-","0000-0001-5685-1283","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/56"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: activity","Sun: coronal mass ejections: CMEs","Sun: flares","Sun: magnetic fields","sunspots","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe authors are grateful to the anonymous referee for helping us improve the manuscript.

If multiple planets form in a circumbinary disk, successive migration will lead to planet-planet scattering (PPS). PPS of Kepler-like circumbinary planets is discussed in this paper. The aim of this paper is to answer how PPS affects the formation of these planets. We find that a close binary has a significant influence on the scattering process. If PPS occurs near the unstable boundary of a binary, about 10% of the systems can be completely destroyed after PPS. In more than 90% of the systems, there is only one planet left. Unlike the eccentricity distribution produced by PPS in a single star system, the surviving planets generally have low eccentricities if PPS take place near the location of the currently found circumbinary planets. In addition, the ejected planets are generally the innermost of two initial planets. The above results depend on the initial positions of the two planets. If the initial positions of the planets are moved away from the binary, the evolution tends toward statistics similar to those around single stars. In this process, the competition between the planet-planet force and the planet-binary force makes the eccentricity distribution of surviving planets diverse. These new features of P-type PPS will deepen our understanding of the formation of these circumbinary planets.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922116","page":["55"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...55G","identifier":["2017ApJ...834...55G","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/55","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/55"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Gong, Yan-Xiang"],"aff":["College of Physics and Electronic Engineering, Taishan University, Taian 271000, China;  School of Astronomy and Space Science & Key Laboratory of Modern Astronomy and Astrophysics in Ministry of Education, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/55"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:20"],"keyword":["binaries: close","methods: numerical","planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability","planets and satellites: individual: Kepler circumbinary planets"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the anonymous referee for constructive comments and suggestions.

We used the algorithms for solar disk image decomposition (SDID) and the spectral irradiance synthesis algorithm (SISA) that we had developed over several years. The SDID algorithm decomposes the images of the solar disk into areas occupied by nine types of chromospheric and 5 types of coronal physical structures. With this decomposition and a set of pre-computed angle-dependent spectra for each of the features, the SISA algorithm is used to calculate the SSI. We discuss the application of the basic SDID/SISA algorithm to a subset of the AIA images and the observed variation occurring in the 2010-2015 period of the relative areas of the solar disk covered by the various solar surface features. Our results consist of the SSI and total solar irradiance variations over the 2010-2015 period. The SSI results include soft X-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and far-infrared observations and can be used for studies of the solar radiative forcing of the Earth’s atmosphere. These SSI estimates were used to drive a thermosphere-ionosphere physical simulation model. Predictions of neutral mass density at low Earth orbit altitudes in the thermosphere and peak plasma densities at mid-latitudes are in reasonable agreement with the observations. The correlation between the simulation results and the observations was consistently better when fluxes computed by SDID/SISA procedures were used.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922109","page":["54"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...54F","identifier":["2017ApJ...834...54F","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/54","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/54"],"bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Fontenla, J.

The only acceptable solutions are concentrated in two narrow sets. In one of them reionization proceeds in two phases: a first one driven by Population III stars, completed at z̃ 10, and after a short recombination period a second one driven by normal galaxies, completed at z̃ 6. In the other set both kinds of sources work in parallel until full reionization at z̃ 6. The best solution with double reionization gives excellent fits to all the observed cosmic histories, but the CMB optical depth is 3σ larger than the recent estimate from the Planck data. Alternatively, the best solution with single reionization gives less good fits to the observed star formation rate density and cold gas mass density histories, but the CMB optical depth is consistent with that estimate. We make several predictions, testable with future observations, that should discriminate between the two reionization scenarios. As a byproduct our models provide a natural explanation to some characteristic features of the cosmic properties at high-z, as well as to the origin of globular clusters.","read_count":33,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922118","page":["49"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...49S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Salvador-Solé, Eduard","Manrique, Alberto","Guzman, Rafael","Rodríguez Espinosa, José Miguel","Gallego, Jesús","Herrero, Artemio","Mas-Hesse, J.

In this work, we explore the effect of photophoresis on the settling of large dust grains in the inner regions of actively accreting protoplanetary disks. Photophoretic forces on dust grains result from the collision of gas molecules with differentially heated grains. We undertake one-dimensional dust settling calculations to determine the equilibrium vertical distribution of dust grains in each column of the disk. In the process we introduce a new treatment of the photophoresis force which is consistent at all optical depths with the representation of the radiative intensity field in a two-stream radiative transfer approximation. The levitation of large dust grains creates a photophoretic dust trap several scale heights above the mid-plane in the inner regions of the disk where the dissipation of accretion energy is significant. We find that differential settling of dust grains is radically altered in these regions of the disk, with large dust grains trapped in a layer below the stellar irradiation surface, where the dust to gas mass ratio can be enhanced by a factor of a hundred for the relevant particles.

Observations estimate the reconnection rate as a small, but non-negligible fraction of the Alfvén speed, so-called fast reconnection. Until recently, the prevailing pictures of reconnection were either of resistivity or plasma microscopic effects, which was contradictory to the observed rates. Alternative pictures were either of reconnection due to the stochasticity of magnetic field lines in turbulence or the tearing instability of the thin current sheet. In this paper we simulate long-term three-dimensional nonlinear evolution of a thin, planar current sheet subject to a fast oblique tearing instability using direct numerical simulations of resistive-viscous magnetohydrodynamics. The late-time evolution resembles generic turbulence with a -5/3 power spectrum and scale-dependent anisotropy, so we conclude that the tearing-driven reconnection becomes turbulent reconnection. The turbulence is local in scale, so microscopic diffusivity should not affect large-scale quantities. This is confirmed by convergence of the reconnection rate toward ̃ 0.015{v}<SUB>{{A</SUB>}} with increasing Lundquist number.

This excess has been interpreted as a population of approximately Jupiter-mass objects that outnumber main-sequence stars nearly twofold; however the microlensing data alone cannot distinguish between events due to wide-separation (a ≳ 10 au) and free-floating planets. Assuming these STEs are indeed due to planetary-mass objects, we aim to constrain the fraction of these events that can be explained by bound but wide-separation planets. We fit the observed timescale distribution with a lens mass function comprised of brown dwarfs, main-sequence stars, and stellar remnants, finding and thus corroborating the initial identification of an excess of STEs. We then include a population of bound planets that are expected not to show signatures of the primary lens (host) in their microlensing light curves and that are also consistent with results from representative microlensing, radial velocity, and direct imaging surveys. We find that bound planets alone cannot explain the entire STE excess without violating the constraints from the surveys we consider and thus some fraction of these events must be due to free-floating planets, if our model for bound planets holds. We estimate a median fraction of STEs due to free-floating planets to be f = 0.67 (0.23 ≤ f ≤ 0.85 at 95% confidence) when assuming “hot-start” planet evolutionary models and f = 0.58 (0.14 ≤ f ≤ 0.83 at 95% confidence) for “cold-start” models.

SGs are rare in galaxy clusters, and indeed, a simple estimate reveals that they are only expected in roughly one in several dozen, to several hundred, massive galaxy clusters (the estimate can easily change by an order of magnitude within a reasonable range of characteristic values relevant for the calculation). Taking advantage of our lens model best-fit, mass-to-light scaling relation for cluster members, we infer that the total mass of the SG system is ̃ 1.3× {10}<SUP>11</SUP> {M}<SUB>☉ </SUB>, with a host-to-companion mass ratio of about 10:1. Despite being rare in high density environments, the SG constitutes an example to how stars of cluster galaxies are efficiently redistributed to the intra-cluster medium. Dedicated numerical simulations for the observed shell configuration, perhaps aided by the mass model, might cast interesting light on the interaction history and properties of the two galaxies. An archival HST search in galaxy cluster images can reveal more such systems.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922188","page":["45"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...45Z","bibgroup":["Keck","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zitrin, Adi"],"aff":["Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics, California Institute of Technology, MC 249-17, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA; Physics Department, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, P.O.

This scenario is thought to be quite common in the interiors of stars and giant planets, and understanding the transport of heat and chemical species by ODDC is of great importance to stellar and planetary evolution models. Fluids unstable to ODDC have a tendency to form convective thermocompositional layers that significantly enhance the fluxes of temperature and chemical composition compared with microscopic diffusion. Although a number of recent studies have focused on studying properties of both layered and nonlayered ODDC, few have addressed how additional physical processes such as global rotation affect its dynamics. In this work, we study first how rotation affects the linear stability properties of rotating ODDC. Using direct numerical simulations, we then analyze the effect of rotation on properties of layered and nonlayered ODDC, and we study how the angle of the rotation axis with respect to the direction of gravity affects layering. We find that rotating systems can be broadly grouped into two categories based on the strength of rotation. The qualitative behavior in the more weakly rotating group is similar to nonrotating ODDC, but strongly rotating systems become dominated by vortices that are invariant in the direction of the rotation vector and strongly influence transport. We find that whenever layers form, rotation always acts to reduce thermal and compositional transport.","read_count":14,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922148","page":["44"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...44M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Moll, Ryan","Garaud, Pascale"],"aff":["Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Baskin School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA","Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Baskin School of Engineering, University of California Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/44"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["convection","hydrodynamics","planets and satellites: general","stars: interiors","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Fluid Dynamics"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"\nThis work was funded by NSF-AST 1211394 and NSF-AST 1412951.

During the pre-eruption period of ̃7 hr, the AIA 94 Å images reveal the emergence of a coronal sigmoid through the interaction between two J-shaped bundles of loops, which proceeds with multiple episodes of coronal loop brightenings and significant variations in the magnetic flux through the photosphere. These observations imply that repetitive magnetic reconnections likely play a key role in the formation of the sigmoidal FR in the corona and also contribute toward sustaining the temperature of the FR higher than that of the ambient coronal structures. Notably, the formation of the sigmoid is associated with the fast morphological evolution of an S-shaped filament channel in the chromosphere. The sigmoid activates toward eruption with the ascent of a large FR in the corona, which is preceded by the decrease in photospheric magnetic flux through the core flaring region, suggesting tether-cutting reconnection as a possible triggering mechanism. The FR eruption results in a two-ribbon M6.5 flare with a prolonged rise phase of ̃21 minutes. The flare exhibits significant deviation from the standard flare model in the early rise phase, during which a pair of J-shaped flare ribbons form and apparently exhibit converging motions parallel to the polarity inversion line, which is further confirmed by the motions of hard X-ray footpoint sources. In the later stages, the flare follows the standard flare model and the source region undergoes a complete sigmoid-to-arcade transformation.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922157","page":["42"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...42J","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Joshi, Bhuwan","Kushwaha, Upendra","Veronig, Astrid M.","Dhara, Sajal Kumar","Shanmugaraju, A.","Moon, Yong-Jae"],"aff":["Udaipur Solar Observatory, Physical Research Laboratory, Udaipur 313001, India","Udaipur Solar Observatory, Physical Research Laboratory, Udaipur 313001, India","Kanzelhöhe Observatory/Institute of Physics, University of Graz, Universitätsplatz 5, A-8010 Graz, Austria","Udaipur Solar Observatory, Physical Research Laboratory, Udaipur 313001, India","Department of Physics, Arul Anandhar College, Karumathur, Tamilnadu 625514, India","School of Space Research, Kyung Hee University, Yongin, Gyeonggi-Do, 446-701, Korea"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0001-6750-4578","0000-0003-2073-002X","-","-","0000-0001-6216-6944"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/42"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: activity","Sun: filaments","prominences","Sun: flares","Sun: X-rays","gamma rays","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the SDO and RHESSI teams for their open data policy.

It has been speculated that the quenched component contained in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is the reason why the star formation main sequence (MS) has a shallow slope at high masses. In this paper, we present a toy model to quantify the quenched mass portion of SFGs (f<SUB>Q</SUB>) at fixed stellar mass (M<SUB>*</SUB>) and to reconcile the MS slopes in both the low- and the high-mass regimes. In this model, each SFG is composed of a star-forming plus a quenched component. The mass of the star-forming component (M<SUB>SF</SUB>) correlates with the star formation rate (SFR) following a relation SFR \\propto {M}<SUB>{SF</SUB>}<SUP>{α </SUP><SUB>{SF</SUB>}}, where α<SUB>SF</SUB> ̃ 1.0. The quenched component contributes to the stellar mass but not to the SFR. It is thus possible to quantify f<SUB>Q</SUB> based on the departure of the observed MS slope α from α<SUB>SF</SUB>. Adopting the redshift-dependent MS slope reported by Whitaker et al., we explore the evolution of the {f}<SUB>{{Q</SUB>}}{--}{M}<SUB>* </SUB> relations over z = [0.5, 2.5]. We find that Milky Way-like SFGs (with {M}<SUB>* </SUB>≈ {10}<SUP>10.7</SUP> {M}<SUB>☉ </SUB>) typically have an f<SUB>Q</SUB> = 30%-40% at z ̃ 2.25, whereas this value rapidly rises up to 70%-80% at z ̃ 0.75. The origin of an α ̃ 1.0 MS slope seen in the low-mass regime is also discussed. We argue for a scenario in which the majority of low-mass SFGs stay in a “steady-stage” star formation phase.

The unraveling of the braided structure was associated with a transient brightening in the EUV and apparently contributed to the formation of a curtain-like structure (CLS). The CLS consisted of myriad thread-like loops rotating counterclockwise about the vertical if viewed from above. Heated prominence material was observed to slide along these loops and land outside the filament channel. The tornado eventually disintegrated and the remaining material flew along a left-handed helical path constituting approximately a full turn, as corroborated through stereoscopic reconstruction, into the cavity of the stable, western section of the prominence. We suggest that the tornado-like evolution of the prominence was governed by the helical kink instability, and that the CLS formed through magnetic reconnections between the prominence field and the overlying coronal field.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922151","page":["38"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...38W","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Wang, Wensi","Liu, Rui","Wang, Yuming"],"aff":["CAS Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment, Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China","CAS Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment, Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China; Collaborative Innovation Center of Astronautical Science and Technology, Hefei 230026, China","CAS Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment, Department of Geophysics and Planetary Sciences, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China; Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information & Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei 230026, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0003-4618-4979","0000-0002-8887-3919"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/38"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["instabilities","Sun: corona","Sun: filaments","prominences","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank B.

This parameterization controls the amount of dependence of galaxy luminosity on halo concentration at a fixed halo mass. Effectively this interpolation scheme enables abundance matching models to have adjustable assembly bias in the resulting galaxy catalogs. With the new 400 {Mpc} {h}<SUP>-1</SUP> DarkSky Simulation, whose larger volume provides lower sample variance, we further show that low-redshift two-point clustering and satellite fraction measurements from SDSS can already provide a joint constraint on this concentration dependence and the scatter within the abundance matching framework.","read_count":65,"citation_count":35,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922189","page":["37"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...37L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Lehmann, Benjamin V.","Mao, Yao-Yuan","Becker, Matthew R.","Skillman, Samuel W.","Wechsler, Risa H."],"aff":["Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA; Department of Physics, University of California, Santa Cruz, CA 95064, USA","Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA; Department of Physics and Astronomy and Pittsburgh Particle Physics, Astrophysics, and Cosmology Center (PITT PACC), University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, PA 15260, USA","Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA; Civis Analytics, West Loop, Chicago, IL 60607, USA","Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA; Descartes Labs, 1350 Central Avenue, Los Alamos, NM 87544, USA","Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology, Department of Physics, Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305, USA; SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Menlo Park, CA, 94025, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-7735-4673","0000-0002-1200-0820","-","-","0000-0003-2229-011X"],"issue":"1","orcid_other":["-","0000-0002-1200-0820","0000-0001-7774-2246","-","-"],"volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/37"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["dark matter","galaxies: halos","methods: analytical","methods: numerical","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nB.V.L. was supported by a Stanford University undergraduate research grant.

We characterize the excess noise using variance and structure function analyses. We find that 26 out of 37 pulsars show inconsistencies with a white-noise-only model based on the short timescale analysis of each pulsar, and we demonstrate that the excess noise has a red power spectrum for 15 pulsars. We also decompose the excess noise into chromatic (radio-frequency-dependent) and achromatic components. Associating the achromatic red-noise component with spin noise and including additional power-spectrum-based estimates from the literature, we estimate a scaling law in terms of spin parameters (frequency and frequency derivative) and data-span length and compare it to the scaling law of Shannon & Cordes.

A self-consistent hybrid model of an SCS is developed in which ion dynamics is described at the quasi-adiabatic approximation, while the electrons are assumed to be magnetized, and their motion is described in the guiding center approximation. The model shows that the SCS profile is determined by the relative contribution of two currents: (I) the current supported by demagnetized protons that move along open quasi-adiabatic orbits, and (II) the electron drift current. The simplest modeled SCS is found to be a multi-layered structure that consists of a thin current sheet embedded into a much thicker analog of a plasma sheet. This result is in good agreement with observations of SCSs at ̃1 au. The analysis of fine structure of different SCSs, including the HCS, shows that an SCS represents a narrow current layer (with a thickness of ̃10<SUP>4</SUP> km) embedded into a wider region of about 10<SUP>5</SUP> km, independently of the SCS origin. Therefore, multi-scale structuring is very likely an intrinsic feature of SCSs in the solar wind.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922159","page":["34"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...34M","identifier":["2017ApJ...834...34M","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/34","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/34"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Malova, H.

We also generated a thermal emission measure map and used it to characterize the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the LHB, which we found to be in good agreement with the structure of the local cavity measured from dust and gas.","read_count":39,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922160","page":["33"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...33L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Liu, W.","Chiao, M.","Collier, M.

The test simulations of the new code rHARM are compared to an analytic solution of the diffusion equation and a classical shock tube problem. We have further investigated the evolution of the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in tori around black holes (BHs) for a range of magnetic diffusivities. We find an indication for a critical magnetic diffusivity (for our setup) beyond which no MRI develops in the linear regime and for which accretion of torus material to the BH is delayed. Preliminary simulations of magnetically diffusive thin accretion disks around Schwarzschild BHs that are threaded by a large-scale poloidal magnetic field show the launching of disk winds with mass fluxes of about 50% of the accretion rate. The disk magnetic diffusivity allows for efficient disk accretion that replenishes the mass reservoir of the inner disk area and thus allows for long-term simulations of wind launching for more than 5000 time units.","read_count":49,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922169","page":["29"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...29Q","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Qian, Qian","Fendt, Christian","Noble, Scott","Bugli, Matteo"],"aff":["Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany;;","Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, Heidelberg, Germany","Department of Physics and Engineering Physics, University of Tulsa, Tulsa, USA","Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics, Garching, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-4797-1547","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/29"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","black hole physics","galaxies: jets","galaxies: nuclei","ISM: jets and outflows","magnetohydrodynamics: MHD","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank Niccolò Bucciantini and Luca Del Zanna for insights concerning the implementation of resistivity in relativistic MHD.

The jet deposits {10}<SUP>51</SUP>{--}{10}<SUP>52</SUP> erg into this cocoon. This is comparable to the energies of the GRB and of the accompanying supernova, yet the cocoon’s signature has been largely ignored. The cocoon radiates a fraction of this energy as it expands, following the breakout from the star, and later as it interacts with the surrounding matter. We explore the possible signatures of this emission and outline a framework to calculate them from the conditions of the cocoon at the time of the jet breakout. The cocoon signature depends strongly on the, currently unknown, mixing between the shocked jet and shocked stellar material. With no mixing the γ-ray emission from the cocoon is so bright that it should have been already detected. The lack of such detections indicates that some mixing must take place. For partial and full mixing the expected signals are weaker than regular GRB afterglows. However, the latter are highly beamed while the former are wider. Future optical, UV, and X-ray transient searches, like LSST, ZTF, ULTRASAT, ISS-Lobster, and others, will most likely detect such signals, providing a wealth of information on the progenitors and jets of GRBs. While we focus on long GRBs, analogous (but weaker) cocoons may arise in short GRBs. Their signatures might be the most promising electromagnetic counterparts for gravitational wave signals from compact binary mergers.","read_count":146,"citation_count":38,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922181","page":["28"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...28N","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Nakar, Ehud","Piran, Tsvi"],"aff":["The Raymond and Beverly Sackler School of Physics and Astronomy, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv 69978, Israel","Racah Institute of Physics, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem 91904, Israel"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-7964-5420"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/28"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:1"],"keyword":["gamma-ray burst: general","gravitational waves","stars: black holes","stars: massive","stars: neutron","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank Ore Gottlieb and Richard Harrison for useful discussions.

It has been assumed so far that these mono-abundance populations (MAPs) are also coeval, or mono-age, populations. Here we study this relationship for a Milky Way chemodynamical model and show that equivalence between MAPs and mono-age populations exists only for the high-[α/Fe] tail, where the chemical evolution curves of different Galactic radii are far apart. At lower [α/Fe]-values an MAP is composed of stars with a range in ages, even for small observational uncertainties and a small MAP bin size. Due to the disk inside-out formation, for these MAPs younger stars are typically located at larger radii, which results in negative radial age gradients that can be as large as 2 Gyr kpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Positive radial age gradients can result for MAPs at the lowest [α/Fe] and highest [Fe/H] end. Such variations with age prevent the simple interpretation of observations for which accurate ages are not available. Studying the variation with radius of the stellar surface density and scale height in our model, we find good agreement to recent analyses of the APOGEE red-clump (RC) sample when 1-4 Gyr old stars dominate (as expected for the RC). Our results suggest that the APOGEE data are consistent with a Milky Way model for which mono-age populations flare for all ages. We propose observational tests for the validity of our predictions and argue that using accurate age measurements, such as from asteroseismology, is crucial for putting constraints on Galactic formation and evolution.","read_count":61,"citation_count":13,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922191","page":["27"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...27M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Minchev, I.","Steinmetz, M.","Chiappini, C.","Martig, M.","Anders, F.","Matijevic, G.","de Jong, R.

Previous interpretations include coronal loops that contract, and it has been speculated that such jerks could be responsible for sunquakes. Here we report the detection of stepwise chromospheric line-of-sight magnetic field (B{}<SUB>{LOS</SUB>}) changes obtained through spectropolarimetry of Ca II 8542 Å with DST/IBIS during the X1-flare SOL20140329T17:48. These changes are stronger (<640 Mx cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) and appear in larger areas than their photospheric counterparts (<320 Mx cm<SUP>-2</SUP>). The absolute value of {B}<SUB>{LOS</SUB>} more often decreases than increases. Photospheric changes are predominantly located near a polarity inversion line, and chromospheric changes near the footpoints of loops. The locations of changes are near, but not exactly co-spatial to hard X-ray emission and neither to enhanced continuum emission nor to a small sunquake. Enhanced chromospheric and coronal emission is observed in nearly all locations that exhibit changes of {B}<SUB>{LOS</SUB>}, but the emission also occurs in many locations without any {B}<SUB>{LOS</SUB>} changes. Photospheric and chromospheric changes of {B}<SUB>{LOS</SUB>} show differences in timing, sign, and size and seem independent of each other. A simple model of contracting loops yields changes of the opposite sign to those observed. An explanation for this discrepancy could be increasing loop sizes or loops that untwist in a certain direction during the flare. It is yet unclear which processes are responsible for the observed changes and their timing, size, and location, especially considering the incoherence between the photosphere and the chromosphere.","citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922205","page":["26"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...26K","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kleint, Lucia"],"aff":["University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland, Bahnhofstrasse 6, 5210 Windisch, Switzerland"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/26"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["Sun: chromosphere","Sun: flares","Sun: magnetic fields","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nI thank Phil Judge, Hugh Hudson, Säm Krucker, and Sebastian Castellanos Duran for their valuable suggestions and discussions and Alina Donea for the sunquake map and explanations.

An in-depth analysis of this apparent disagreement investigates the detectability by means of ZDM of a variety of abundance structures, including (warped) rings predicted by theory, but also complex spot-like structures. Even when spectra of high signal-to-noise ratio are available, it can prove difficult or altogether impossible to correctly recover shapes, positions, and abundances of a mere handful of spots, notwithstanding the use of all four Stokes parameters and an exactly known field geometry; the recovery of (warped) rings can be equally challenging. Inversions of complex abundance maps that are based on just one or two spectral lines usually permit multiple solutions. It turns out that it can by no means be guaranteed that any of the regularization functions in general use for ZDM (maximum entropy or Tikhonov) will lead to a true abundance map instead of some spurious one. Attention is drawn to the need for a study that would elucidate the relation between the stratified, field-dependent abundance structures predicted by diffusion theory on the one hand, and empirical maps obtained by means of “canonical” ZDM, I.e., with mean atmospheres and unstratified abundances, on the other hand. Finally, we point out difficulties arising from the three-dimensional nature of the atomic diffusion process in magnetic ApBp star atmospheres.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14922126","page":["24"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...24S","identifier":["2017ApJ...834...24S","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/24","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/24"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Stift, Martin J.","Leone, Francesco"],"aff":["Armagh Observatory, College Hill, Armagh BT61 9DG, UK; Università degli Studi di Catania, Osservatorio Astrofisico di Catania, via S.

As an illustrative example, we associate primordial metals with abundance ratios used by Keller et al. to explain the source of metals in the star SMSS J031300.36-670839.3, finding good agreement with the observed [Fe/H], [C/H], [O/H], and [Mg/Ca] ratios in CEMP-no Milky Way halo stars.

Multiwavelength images trace an almost sphere-like shell morphology of the region, which is filled with the 0.5-2 keV X-ray emission. The region contains two distinct environments—a bell-shaped cavity-like structure containing the peak of 1.4 GHz emission at center, and elongated filamentary features without any radio detection at edges of the sphere-like shell—where Herschel clumps are detected. Using the 1.4 GHz continuum and <SUP>12</SUP>CO line data, the S237 region is found to be excited by a radio spectral type of B0.5V star and is associated with an expanding H II region. The photoionized gas appears to be responsible for the origin of the bell-shaped structure. The majority of molecular gas is distributed toward a massive Herschel clump (M<SUB>clump</SUB> ̃ 260 {M}<SUB>☉ </SUB>), which contains the filamentary features and has a noticeable velocity gradient. The photometric analysis traces the clusters of young stellar objects (YSOs) mainly toward the bell-shaped structure and the filamentary features. Considering the lower dynamical age of the H II region (I.e., 0.2-0.8 Myr), these clusters are unlikely to be formed by the expansion of the H II region. Our results also show the existence of a cluster of YSOs and a massive clump at the intersection of filamentary features, indicating that the collisions of these features may have triggered cluster formation, similar to those found in the Serpens South region.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922134","page":["22"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...22D","bibgroup":["NRAO","Herschel","NRAO/Telescopes","Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Dewangan, L.

By analysis of archival RXTE data of six oscillation sources, we investigate the accretion rate dependence of the amplitude of burst oscillations. This more than doubles the size of the sample analyzed previously by Muno et al., who found indications for a relationship between accretion rate and oscillation amplitudes. We find that burst oscillation signals can be detected at all observed accretion rates. Moreover, oscillations at low accretion rates are found to have relatively small amplitudes ({A}<SUB>{{rms</SUB>}}≤slant 0.10) while oscillations detected in bursts observed at high accretion rates cover a broad spread in amplitudes (0.05≤slant {A}<SUB>{{rms</SUB>}}≤slant 0.20). In this paper we present the results of our analysis and discuss these in the light of current burst oscillation models. Additionally, we investigate the bursts of two sources without previously detected oscillations.

Analysis of our Keck spectra together with measurements derived from associated Hubble Space Telescope images reveals increasingly larger stellar velocity dispersions and smaller sizes to redshifts beyond z̃ 2. By classifying our sample according to Sérsic indices, we find that among disk-like systems the flatter ones show a higher dynamical to stellar mass ratio compared to their rounder counterparts, which we interpret as evidence for a significant contribution of rotational motion. For this subset of disk-like systems, we estimate that V/σ , the ratio of the circular velocity to the intrinsic velocity dispersion, is a factor of two larger than for present-day disky quiescent galaxies. We use the velocity dispersion measurements also to explore the redshift evolution of the dynamical to stellar mass ratio, and to measure for the first time the physical size growth rate of individual systems over two distinct redshift ranges, finding a faster evolution at earlier times. We discuss the physical origin of this time-dependent growth in size in the context of the associated reduction of the systematic rotation.","citation_count":10,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922207","page":["18"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...18B","bibgroup":["Keck","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Belli, Sirio","Newman, Andrew B.","Ellis, Richard S."],"aff":["Max-Planck-Institut für Extraterrestrische Physik (MPE), Giessenbachstr. 1, D-85748 Garching, Germany","The Observatories of the Carnegie Institution for Science, 813 Santa Barbara St., Pasadena, CA 91101, USA","European Southern Observatory, Karl-Schwarzschild Str. 2, D-85748 Garching, Germany; Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London, Gower Place, London WC1E 6BT, UK; Department of Astronomy, California Institute of Technology, MS 249-17, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-5615-6018","0000-0001-7769-8660","0000-0001-7782-7071"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/18"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["ESA:1","MAST:1","SIMBAD:4"],"keyword":["galaxies: evolution","galaxies: formation","galaxies: high-redshift","galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","galaxies: stellar content","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the referee for a helpful and thorough report.

Increasingly, new planet discoveries are being announced with a measurement of one of these quantities, but not both. This has led to a growing need to forecast the missing quantity using the other, especially when predicting the detectability of certain follow-up observations. We present an unbiased forecasting model built upon a probabilistic mass-radius relation conditioned on a sample of 316 well-constrained objects. Our publicly available code, Forecaster, accounts for observational errors, hyper-parameter uncertainties, and the intrinsic dispersions observed in the calibration sample. By conditioning our model on a sample spanning dwarf planets to late-type stars, Forecaster can predict the mass (or radius) from the radius (or mass) for objects covering nine orders of magnitude in mass. Classification is naturally performed by our model, which uses four classes we label as Terran worlds, Neptunian worlds, Jovian worlds, and stars. Our classification identifies dwarf planets as merely low-mass Terrans (like the Earth) and brown dwarfs as merely high-mass Jovians (like Jupiter). We detect a transition in the mass-radius relation at {2.0}<SUB>-0.6</SUB><SUP>+0.7</SUP> M<SUB>⊕</SUB>, which we associate with the divide between solid, Terran worlds and Neptunian worlds. This independent analysis adds further weight to the emerging consensus that rocky super-Earths represent a narrower region of parameter space than originally thought. Effectively, then, the Earth is the super-Earth we have been looking for.","read_count":185,"citation_count":45,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922124","page":["17"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...17C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Chen, Jingjing","Kipping, David"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy Columbia University 550 W 120th Street New York, NY 10027, USA","Department of Astronomy Columbia University 550 W 120th Street New York, NY 10027, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-6233-3412","0000-0002-4365-7366"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/17"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["CDS:1","SIMBAD:289"],"keyword":["methods: statistics","planetary systems","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["Probabilistic Forecasting of the Masses and Radii of Other Worlds"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-12T19:08:35.056Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161104435M"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161104435M","2017ApJ...834...16M","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/16","10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/16","2016arXiv161104435M","1611.04435"],"first_author":"Mihos, J.

The goal of this survey was to detect and study very low surface brightness features present in Virgo, including discrete tidal features, the faint halos of luminous galaxies, and the diffuse intracluster light (ICL). Our observations span roughly 16 degrees<SUP>2</SUP> in two filters, reaching a 3σ limiting depth of {μ }<SUB>B</SUB> = 29.5 and {μ }<SUB>V</SUB> = 28.5 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>. At these depths, our limiting systematic uncertainties are astrophysical: variations in faint background sources as well as scattered light from galactic dust. We show that this dust-scattered light is well traced by deep far-infrared imaging, making it possible to separate it from true diffuse light in Virgo. We use our imaging to trace and measure the color of the diffuse tidal streams and ICL in the Virgo core near M87, in fields adjacent to the core including the M86/M84 region, and to the south of the core around M49 and subcluster B, along with the more distant W{}<SUP>\\prime </SUP> cloud around NGC 4365. Overall, the bulk of the projected ICL is found in the Virgo core and within the W{}<SUP>\\prime </SUP> cloud; we find little evidence for an extensive ICL component in the field around M49. The bulk of the ICL we detect is fairly red in color (B - V = 0.7-0.9), indicative of old, evolved stellar populations. Based on the luminosity of the observed ICL features in the cluster, we estimate a total Virgo ICL fraction of 7%-15%. This value is somewhat smaller than that expected for massive, evolved clusters, suggesting that Virgo is still in the process of growing its extended ICL component. We also trace the shape of M87's extremely boxy outer halo out to ̃150 kpc, and show that the current tidal stripping rate from low luminosity galaxies is insufficient to have built M87's outer halo over a Hubble time. We identify a number of previously unknown low surface brightness structures around galaxies projected close to M86 and M84. The extensive diffuse light seen in the infalling W{}<SUP>\\prime </SUP> cloud around NGC 4365 is likely to be subsumed in the general Virgo ICL component once the group enters the cluster, illustrating the importance of group infall in generating ICL. Finally, we also identify another large and extremely low surface brightness ultradiffuse galaxy, likely in the process of being shredded by the cluster tidal field. With the survey complete, the full imaging data set is now available for public release.","read_count":72,"citation_count":15,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922111","page":["16"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...16M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mihos, J.

Using this result, we compare observed and predicted color distributions of SN Ia hosts for the MENeaCS cluster supernova survey, and for the SDSS Stripe 82 supernova survey. The observations are consistent with a continuous DTD, without any cutoff. For old progenitor systems, the power-law slope for the DTD is found to be -{1.50}<SUB>-0.15</SUB><SUP>+0.19</SUP>. This result favors the double degenerate scenario for SN Ia, though other interpretations are possible. We find that the late-time slopes of the DTD are different at the 1σ level for low and high stretch supernova, which suggest a single degenerate (SD) scenario for the latter. However, due to ambiguity in the current models’ DTD predictions, SD progenitors can neither be confirmed as causing high stretch supernovae nor ruled out from contributing to the overall sample.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922153","page":["15"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...15H","bibgroup":["CFHT"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Heringer, Epson","Pritchet, Chris","Kezwer, Jason","Graham, Melissa L.","Sand, David","Bildfell, Chris"],"aff":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Victoria, P.O.

The occurrence of solar flares is highly dependent on the structure and topology of solar magnetic fields. A new method for predicting large (M- and X-class) flares is presented, which uses machine learning methods applied to the Zernike moments (ZM) of magnetograms observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory for a period of six years from 2010 June 2 to 2016 August 1. Magnetic field images consisting of the radial component of the magnetic field are converted to finite sets of ZMs and fed to the support vector machine classifier. ZMs have the capability to elicit unique features from any 2D image, which may allow more accurate classification. The results indicate whether an arbitrary active region has the potential to produce at least one large flare. We show that the majority of large flares can be predicted within 48 hr before their occurrence, with only 10 false negatives out of 385 flaring active region magnetograms and 21 false positives out of 179 non-flaring active region magnetograms. Our method may provide a useful tool for the prediction of solar flares, which can be employed alongside other forecasting methods.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922171","page":["11"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...11R","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Raboonik, Abbas","Safari, Hossein","Alipour, Nasibe","Wheatland, Michael S."],"aff":["Department of Physics, University of Zanjan, P.O.

We implement the relevant coronal physics in terms of optically thin radiative loss, field aligned heat conduction, and an equilibrium ionization equation of state. We artificially limit the coronal Alfvén and heat conduction speeds to computationally manageable values using an approximation to semi-relativistic MHD with an artificially reduced speed of light (Boris correction). We present example solutions ranging from quiet to active Sun in order to verify the validity of our approach. We quantify the role of numerical diffusivity for the effective coronal heating. We find that the (numerical) magnetic Prandtl number determines the ratio of resistive to viscous heating and that owing to the very large magnetic Prandtl number of the solar corona, heating is expected to happen predominantly through viscous dissipation. We find that reasonable solutions can be obtained with values of the reduced speed of light just marginally larger than the maximum sound speed. Overall this leads to a fully explicit code that can compute the time evolution of the solar corona in response to photospheric driving using numerical time steps not much smaller than 0.1 s. Numerical simulations of the coronal response to flux emergence covering a time span of a few days are well within reach using this approach.","read_count":61,"citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922183","page":["10"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834...10R","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Rempel, M."],"aff":["High Altitude Observatory, NCAR, P.O.

The three galaxies—but especially Leo A and Aquarius—share in common delayed star formation histories (SFHs) relative to many other isolated dwarf galaxies. The stars in all three galaxies are supported by dispersion. We found no evidence of stellar velocity structure, even for Aquarius, which has rotating H I gas. The velocity dispersions indicate that all three galaxies are dark-matter-dominated, with dark-to-baryonic mass ratios ranging from {4.4}<SUB>-0.8</SUB><SUP>+1.0</SUP> (SagDIG) to {9.6}<SUB>-1.8</SUB><SUP>+2.5</SUP> (Aquarius). Leo A and SagDIG have lower stellar metallicities than Aquarius, and they also have higher gas fractions, both of which would be expected if Aquarius were further along in its chemical evolution. The metallicity distribution of Leo A is inconsistent with a closed or leaky box model of chemical evolution, suggesting that the galaxy was pre-enriched or acquired external gas during star formation. The metallicities of stars increased steadily for all three galaxies, but possibly at different rates. The [α/Fe] ratios at a given [Fe/H] are lower than that of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy, which indicates more extended SFHs than Sculptor, consistent with photometrically derived SFHs. Overall, the bulk kinematic and chemical properties for the late-forming dwarf galaxies do not diverge significantly from those of less delayed dwarf galaxies, including dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

The weighting schemes are designed with a view to minimizing the statistical error without introducing systematic errors. It would be ideal to approach the Cramér-Rao bound (the lower bound of the statistical uncertainty) in shear statistics, though it is generally difficult to do so in practice. The reasons may include difficulties in galaxy shape measurement, inaccurate knowledge of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the shear estimator, misidentification of point sources as galaxies, etc. Using the shear estimators defined by Zhang et al., we show that one can overcome these problems, and allow shear measurement accuracy to approach the Cramér-Rao bound. This can be achieved by symmetrizing the PDF of the shear estimator, or the joint PDF of shear estimator pairs (for shear-shear correlation), without any prior knowledge of the PDF. Using simulated galaxy images, we demonstrate that under general observing conditions, this idea works as expected: it minimizes the statistical uncertainty without introducing systematic error.","read_count":28,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922132","page":["8"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834....8Z","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Zhang, Jun","Zhang, Pengjie","Luo, Wentao"],"aff":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China","Department of Physics and Astronomy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China","Key Laboratory for Research in Galaxies and Cosmology, Shanghai Astronomical Observatory, Shanghai 200030, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","0000-0003-1297-6142"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/8"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","keyword":["gravitational lensing: weak","large-scale structure of universe","methods: data analysis","techniques: image processing","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe authors thank Eiichiro Komatsu for motivating this work, and Zuhui Fan, Liping Fu, Guoliang Li, Chenggang Shu for useful discussions.

The tidally induced, two-armed, approximately logarithmic spiral structure forms on each of them during the pericenter passages. The spiral arms dissipate and wind up with time, to be triggered again at the next pericenter passage. We confirm this transient and recurrent nature of the arms by analyzing the time evolution of the pitch angle and the arm strength. We find that the strongest arms are formed on the tightest orbit; however, they wind up rather quickly and are disturbed by another pericenter passage. The arms on the most extended orbit, which we analyze in more detail, wind up slowly and survive for the longest time. Measurements of the pattern speed of the arms indicate that they are kinematic density waves. We attempt a comparison with observations by selecting grand-design spiral galaxies in the Virgo cluster. Among those, we find nine examples bearing no sign of recent interactions or the presence of companions. For three of them we present close structural analogues among our simulated spiral galaxies.","read_count":56,"citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922142","page":["7"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834....7S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Semczuk, Marcin","Łokas, Ewa L.","del Pino, Andrés"],"aff":["Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center, Polish Academy of Sciences, Bartycka 18, 00-716 Warsaw, Poland; Warsaw University Observatory, Al.

The [C II]/TIR ratio ranges from above 1% to below 0.1% in the sample, with a mean value of 0.48 ± 0.21%. We find that the surface density of 24 μm emission dominates this trend, with [C II]/TIR dropping as ν {I}<SUB>ν </SUB>(24 μ {{m}}) increases. Deviations from this overall decline are correlated with changes in the gas-phase metal abundance, with higher metallicity associated with deeper deficits at a fixed surface brightness. We supplement the local sample with resolved [C II] measurements from nearby luminous infrared galaxies and high-redshift sources from z = 1.8-6.4, and find that star formation rate density drives a continuous trend of deepening [C II] deficit across six orders of magnitude in {{{Σ }}}<SUB>{{sfr</SUB>}}. The tightness of this correlation suggests that an approximate {{{Σ }}}<SUB>{{sfr</SUB>}} can be estimated directly from global measurements of [C II]/TIR, and a relation is provided to do so. Several low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN) hosts in the sample show additional and significant central suppression of [C II]/TIR, but these deficit enhancements occur not in those AGNs with the highest X-ray luminosities, but instead those with the highest central starlight intensities. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the [C II] line-cooling line deficit in galaxies likely arises from local physical phenomena in interstellar gas.","citation_count":14,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922167","page":["5"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834....5S","bibgroup":["Leiden Observatory","CXC","Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Smith, J.

Fermi-LAT observations have resolved the gamma-ray emissions from these two pulsars and found pulsed emissions from PSR J0540-6919. The total pulsed radiation in the X-ray/gamma-ray energy bands of PSR J0540-6919 is observed with efficiency {η }<SUB>J0540</SUB>̃ 0.06 (in 4π sr), which is about a factor of ten larger than {η }<SUB>{Crab</SUB>}̃ 0.006 of the Crab pulsar.

This paper mainly discusses what causes the difference in the radiation efficiencies of these three energetic Crab-like pulsars. We discuss electron/positron acceleration and high-energy emission processes within the outer gap model. By solving the outer gap structure with the dipole magnetic field, we show that the radiation efficiency decreases as the inclination angle between the magnetic axis and the rotation axis increases. To explain the difference in the pulse profile and in the radiation efficiency, our model suggests that PSR J0540-6919 has an inclination angle much smaller than that of the Crab pulsar (here we assume the inclination angles of both pulsars are α < 90^\\circ ). On the other hand, we speculate that the difference in the radiation efficiencies between PSRs J0537-6910 and J0549-6919 is mainly caused by the difference in the Earth viewing angle, and that we see PSR J0537-6910 with an Earth viewing angle \\zeta \\gg 90^\\circ (or \\ll 90^\\circ ) measured from the spin axis, while we see PSR J0540-6919 with \\zeta ̃ 90^\\circ .","read_count":36,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922174","page":["4"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834....4T","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Takata, J.","Cheng, K.

It is therefore essential to observe blazars simultaneously at different wavelengths, especially in the X-ray and gamma-ray bands, where the broadband spectral energy distributions usually peak. In this work, we report on three “target-of-opportunity” observations of Mrk 421, one of the brightest TeV blazars, triggered by a strong flaring event at TeV energies in 2014. These observations feature long, continuous, and simultaneous exposures with XMM-Newton (covering the X-ray and optical/ultraviolet bands) and VERITAS (covering the TeV gamma-ray band), along with contemporaneous observations from other gamma-ray facilities (MAGIC and Fermi-Large Area Telescope) and a number of radio and optical facilities. Although neither rapid flares nor significant X-ray/TeV correlation are detected, these observations reveal subtle changes in the X-ray spectrum of the source over the course of a few days. We search the simultaneous X-ray and TeV data for spectral hysteresis patterns and time delays, which could provide insight into the emission mechanisms and the source properties (e.g., the radius of the emitting region, the strength of the magnetic field, and related timescales). The observed broadband spectra are consistent with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model. We find that the power spectral density distribution at ≳4 × 10<SUP>-4</SUP> Hz from the X-ray data can be described by a power-law model with an index value between 1.2 and 1.8, and do not find evidence for a steepening of the power spectral index (often associated with a characteristic length scale) compared to the previously reported values at lower frequencies.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922202","page":["2"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834....2A","bibgroup":["XMM","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Abeysekara, A.

Furthermore, we present evidence that some polluted white dwarfs (including SDSS J1043+0855) allow us to examine the structure of differentiated extrasolar rocky bodies. Enhanced levels of carbon in the body polluting SDSS J1043+0855 relative to the Earth-Moon system can be explained with a model where a significant amount of the accreted rocky minerals took the form of carbonates; specifically, through this model the accreted material could be up to 9% calcium-carbonate by mass.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14922108","page":["1"],"bibcode":"2017ApJ...834....1M","bibgroup":["Keck","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Melis, Carl","Dufour, P."],"aff":["Center for Astrophysics and Space Sciences, University of California, San Diego, CA 92093-0424, USA","Institut de Recherche sur les Exoplanètes (iREx), Université de Montréal, Montréal, QC H3C 3J7, Canada"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-9834-7579","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"834","doi":["10.3847/1538-4357/834/1/1"],"pub":"The Astrophysical Journal","data":["ESA:1","MAST:1","SIMBAD:7"],"keyword":["circumstellar matter","planet─star interactions","stars: abundances","stars: individual: SDSS J104341.53+085558.2","white dwarfs","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nC.M. would like to acknowledge the profound impact the late Prof. Michael Jura had on his development into a scientist; he will be sorely missed, especially within the community of scholars who study white dwarf planetary systems.

Many previous authors have noted that stars in our universe would have difficulty producing carbon and other heavy elements in the absence of the well-known <SUP>12</SUP>C resonance at 7.6 MeV. This resonance is necessary because <SUP>8</SUP>Be is unstable in our universe, so that carbon must be produced via the triple alpha reaction to achieve the requisite abundance. Although a moderate change in the energy of the resonance (200-300 keV) will indeed affect carbon production, an even smaller change in the binding energy of beryllium (∼100 keV) would allow <SUP>8</SUP>Be to be stable. A stable isotope with A = 8 would obviate the need for the triple alpha process in general, and the <SUP>12</SUP>C resonance in particular, for carbon production. This paper explores the possibility that <SUP>8</SUP>Be can be stable in other universes. Simple nuclear considerations indicate that bound states can be realized, with binding energy ∼ 0.1 - 1 MeV, if the fundamental constants vary by a ∼ few - 10 %. In such cases, <SUP>8</SUP>Be can be synthesized through helium burning, and <SUP>12</SUP>C can be produced later through nuclear burning of beryllium. This paper focuses on stellar models that burn helium into beryllium; once the universe in question has a supply of stable beryllium, carbon production can take place during subsequent evolution in the same star or in later stellar generations. Using both a semi-analytic stellar structure model as well as a state-of-the-art stellar evolution code, we find that viable stellar configurations that produce beryllium exist over a wide range of parameter space. Finally, we demonstrate that carbon can be produced during later evolutionary stages.","read_count":78,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921287","page":["40"],"bibcode":"2017APh....87...40A","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Adams, Fred C.","Grohs, Evan"],"aff":["Physics Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States; Astronomy Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States","Physics Department, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"volume":"87","doi":["10.1016/j.astropartphys.2016.12.002"],"pub":"Astroparticle Physics","keyword":["Fine-tuning","Multiverse","Stellar nucleosynthesis","Triple alpha","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Nuclear Theory"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Anthony Aguirre, Kate Coppess, Juliette Becker, George Fuller, Minhyun Kay, Mark Paris, Nicole Vassh, Stan Woosley, and Coco Zhang for useful discussions.

In this work we derive an analytic parameterization of the particle distributions at ground from air shower simulations convolved with the response of a surface detector array. Shower particles are classified into four components according to the shower component they belong to: the muonic component, the electromagnetic component stemming from muon interactions and muon decay, the purely electromagnetic component, and the newly introduced electromagnetic component from low-energy hadrons. Using this scheme, we will show that the total signal at ground level for different surface detectors can be described with minimal fluctuations with parameterizations depending on the primary energy, position of the shower maximum, and the overall number of muons in the shower. The simulation results for different combinations of primaries and hadronic interaction models are reproduced with an accuracy better than 5-10% in the range from 100 m to 2000 m from the shower core. This parameterization is then used as a Lateral Distribution ansatz to reconstruct showers in current EAS experiments. Since this ansatz depends on physical parameters, it opens the possibility to infer them from data.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921258","page":["23"],"bibcode":"2017APh....87...23A","identifier":["2017APh....87...23A","10.1016/j.astropartphys.2016.11.008","10.1016/j.astropartphys.2016.11.008"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Ave, M.","Engel, R.","Roth, M.","Schulz, A."],"aff":["Instituto de Física de São Carlos, Universidade de São Paulo, CP 369, 13560-970, São Carlos, SP, Brasil","Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany","Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany","Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Karlsruhe, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","0000-0002-0032-2531"],"volume":"87","doi":["10.1016/j.astropartphys.2016.11.008"],"pub":"Astroparticle Physics","keyword":["Air shower simulation","UHECR","Mass composition"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementWe would like to acknowledge many fruitful discussions with our colleagues of the Pierre Auger collaboration, in particular at Instituto de Fsica de So Carlos, Centro Atomico Bariloche, TANDAR and KIT.

The model can be interpreted as a particular case of the class recently discussed by Perico et al. (2013) [25] which is termed complete in the sense that the cosmic evolution occurs between two extreme de Sitter stages (early and late time de Sitter phases). The gravitational wave equation is derived and its time-dependent part numerically integrated since the primordial de Sitter stage. The generated spectrum of gravitons is also compared with the standard calculations where an abrupt transition, from the early de Sitter to the radiation phase, is usually assumed. It is found that the stochastic background of gravitons is very similar to the one predicted by the cosmic concordance model plus inflation except at higher frequencies (ν ≳ 100 kHz). This remarkable signature of a \"running vacuum\" cosmology combined with the proposed high frequency gravitational wave detectors and measurements of the CMB polarization (B-modes) may provide a new window to confront more conventional models of inflation.","read_count":14,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921253","page":["18"],"bibcode":"2017APh....87...18T","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Tamayo, D.

U.","abstract":"TARA (Telescope Array Radar) is a cosmic ray radar detection experiment colocated with Telescope Array, the conventional surface scintillation detector (SD) and fluorescence telescope detector (FD) near Delta, Utah, U.S.A. The TARA detector combines a 40 kW, 54.1 MHz VHF transmitter and high-gain transmitting antenna which broadcasts the radar carrier over the SD array and within the FD field of view, towards a 250 MS/s DAQ receiver. TARA has been collecting data since 2013 with the primary goal of observing the radar signatures of extensive air showers (EAS). Simulations indicate that echoes are expected to be short in duration (∼ 10 μs) and exhibit rapidly changing frequency, with rates on the order 1 MHz/μs. The EAS radar cross-section (RCS) is currently unknown although it is the subject of over 70 years of speculation. A novel signal search technique is described in which the expected radar echo of a particular air shower is used as a matched filter template and compared to waveforms obtained by triggering the radar DAQ using the Telescope Array fluorescence detector. No evidence for the scattering of radio frequency radiation by EAS is obtained to date. We report the first quantitative RCS upper limits using EAS that triggered the Telescope Array Fluorescence Detector. The transmitter is under the direct control of experimenters, and in a radio-quiet area isolated from other radio frequency (RF) sources. The power and radiation pattern are known at all times.</ce:para> Forward power up to 40 kW and gain exceeding 20 dB maximize energy density in the radar field.</ce:para> Continuous wave (CW) transmission gives 100% duty cycle, as opposed to pulsed radar.</ce:para> TARA utilizes a high sample rate DAQ (250 MS/s).</ce:para> TARA is colocated with a large state-of-the-art conventional CR observatory, allowing the radar data stream to be sampled at the arrival times of known cosmic ray events.</ce:para> </ce:para>Each of these attributes of the TARA detector has been discussed in detail in the literature [8]. A map showing the TA SD array and the location of the TARA transmitter and receiver is shown in Fig. 1.</ce:para>Section 2 of this paper includes a description of air shower plasmas and possible radio scattering mechanisms. Theoretical and experimental parameters that influence radio scattering are presented and discussed. We justify use of the thin wire model in a radar echo simulation that predicts echo waveforms, which we will subsequently (Section 6) use in placing limits on the air shower radar cross section (RCS). Sections 3 and 4 describe TARA data and offline processing techniques. In Section 5, we describe the signal search using simulated waveforms as matched filter (MF) templates in order to maximize sensitivity. Section 6 describes the procedure for calculating a scale factor to the RCS model described in Section 2, the results of which are used in placing the first quantitative upper limit on the EAS radar cross-section (RCS). In Section 7 we summarize these results and discuss the viability of radar detection of cosmic rays in light of the TARA findings.</ce:para></ce:section>","read_count":30,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921227","page":["1"],"bibcode":"2017APh....87....1A","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Abbasi, R.

Four promising sources are identified based on having a large flux and a flat spectrum. We subsequently evaluate the probability of their identification above the atmospheric neutrino background in IceCube data as a function of time. We show that observing them over the twenty-year lifetime of the instrumentation is likely, and that some should be observable at the 3 σ level with six years of data. In the absence of positive results, we derive constraints on the spectral index and cut-off energy of the sources, assuming a hadronic acceleration mechanism.","read_count":31,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921305","page":["46"],"bibcode":"2017APh....86...46H","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Halzen, Francis","Kheirandish, Ali","Niro, Viviana"],"aff":["Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center and Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA","Wisconsin IceCube Particle Astrophysics Center and Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53706, USA","Departamento de Física Teórica, Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, and Instituto de Física Teórica UAM/CSIC, Calle Nicolás Cabrera 13-15, Cantoblanco, E-28049 Madrid, Spain"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","0000-0003-4409-6852"],"volume":"86","doi":["10.1016/j.astropartphys.2016.11.004"],"pub":"Astroparticle Physics","keyword":["High-energy neutrinos","Neutrino astronomy","High-energy cosmic-ray physics and astrophysics","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Markus Ahlers, Chad Finley, M.C.Gonzalez-Garcia, Zigfried Hampel, Teresa Montaruli, Amanda Weinstein, and Tom Weisgarber for useful discussions.

We found that by changing the energy spectrum by an amount consistent with the difference between current models (namely EPOS-LHC and QGSJET-II.04), the muon surface density at ground increases 5% at 20° zenith angle and 17% at 60° zenith angle. This effect introduces a zenith angle dependence on the reconstructed number of muons which might be experimentally observed. The maximum of the muon production depth distribution at 40° increases ∼ 10 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> and ∼ 0 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> at 60°, which, from pure geometrical considerations, increases the arrival time delay of muons. There is an extra contribution to the delay due to the subluminal velocities of muons of the order of ∼ 3 ns at all zenith angles. Finally, changes introduced in the logarithmic slope of the lateral density function are less than 2%.","read_count":18,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921220","page":["32"],"bibcode":"2017APh....86...32E","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Espadanal, J.","Cazon, L.","Conceição, R."],"aff":["LIP, Av.

To study their origin one can search for anisotropy in their arrival directions. Extragalactic cosmic rays should be isotropic, but galactic cosmic rays of this type should be seen mostly along the galactic plane, and there should be a shortage of events coming from directions near the galactic anticenter. This is due to the fact that, under the influence of the galactic magnetic field, the transition from ballistic to diffusive behavior is well advanced, and this qualitative picture persists over the whole energy range. Guided by models of the galactic magnetic field that indicate that the enhancement along the galactic plane should have a standard deviation of about 20° in galactic latitude, and the deficit in the galactic anticenter direction should have a standard deviation of about 50° in galactic longitude, we use the data of the Telescope Array surface detector in 10<SUP>18.0</SUP> to 10<SUP>18.5</SUP> eV energy range to search for these effects. The data are isotropic. Neither an enhancement along the galactic plane nor a deficit in the galactic anticenter direction is found. Using these data we place an upper limit on the fraction of EeV cosmic rays of galactic origin at 1.3% at 95% confidence level.","read_count":33,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921246","page":["21"],"bibcode":"2017APh....86...21A","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V.

No statistically significant excess over background is observed. We look for electron antineutrinos (νbar<SUB>e</SUB>) that inverse beta decay on protons with energies from 1.8 MeV to 15 MeV and set the best limit on the neutrino fluence from GRBs below 8 MeV. The signals from neutrinos and antineutrinos from GRBs that scatter on electrons are also searched for, a detection channel made possible by the particularly radio-pure scintillator of Borexino. We obtain currently the best limits on the neutrino fluence of all flavors and species below 7 MeV. Finally, time correlations between GRBs and bursts of events are investigated. Our analysis combines two semi-independent data acquisition systems for the first time: the primary Borexino readout optimized for solar neutrino physics up to a few MeV, and a fast waveform digitizer system tuned for events above 1 MeV.","read_count":47,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921285","page":["11"],"bibcode":"2017APh....86...11A","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Agostini, M.","Altenmüller, K.","Appel, S.","Atroshchenko, V.","Bellini, G.","Benziger, J.","Bick, D.","Bonfini, G.","Bravo, D.","Caccianiga, B.","Calaprice, F.","Caminata, A.","Carlini, M.","Cavalcante, P.","Chepurnov, A.","Choi, K.","D'Angelo, D.","Davini, S.","de Kerret, H.","Derbin, A.","Di Noto, L.","Drachnev, I.","Etenko, A.","Fomenko, K.","Franco, D.","Gabriele, F.","Galbiati, C.","Ghiano, C.","Giammarchi, M.","Goeger-Neff, M.","Goretti, A.","Gromov, M.","Hagner, C.","Hungerford, E.","Ianni, Aldo","Ianni, Andrea","Jany, A.","Jedrzejczak, K.","Jeschke, D.","Kobychev, V.","Korablev, D.","Korga, G.","Kryn, D.","Laubenstein, M.","Lehnert, B.","Litvinovich, E.","Lombardi, F.","Lombardi, P.","Ludhova, L.","Lukyanchenko, G.","Machulin, I.","Manecki, S.","Maneschg, W.","Manuzio, G.","Marcocci, S.","Meroni, E.","Meyer, M.","Miramonti, L.","Misiaszek, M.","Montuschi, M.","Mosteiro, P.","Muratova, V.","Neumair, B.","Oberauer, L.","Obolensky, M.","Ortica, F.","Pallavicini, M.","Papp, L.","Pocar, A.","Ranucci, G.","Razeto, A.","Re, A.","Romani, A.","Roncin, R.","Rossi, N.","Schönert, S.","Semenov, D.","Skorokhvatov, M.","Smirnov, O.","Sotnikov, A.","Sukhotin, S.","Suvorov, Y.","Tartaglia, R.","Testera, G.","Thurn, J.","Toropova, M.","Unzhakov, E.","Vishneva, A.","Vogelaar, R.

In this paper, we mainly give constraints on the EoS of dark energy w with the latest observations of cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB) from Planck satellite, JLA Type Ia supernovae (SNIa) sample, baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Hubble parameter measurements. We introduce a kind of parameterized dark energy model called \"constant bin - w \", in which the whole redshift range is divided into several bins, and EoS w in each bin is assumed as an independent constant. The results show that EoS in all of the redshift bins are comparable with ΛCDM in the 2σ confidence regions, but some weak deviations from w = - 1 are still indicated. In particular, in the framework of 7 bins, a slight oscillation behavior is shown in the redshift 0 < z < 0.75, especially around the range of 4th bin (0.25 < z < 0.35) and 5th bin (0.35 < z < 0.51). Additionally, we adopt the principal component analysis (PCA) method to do the model-independent analysis, which includes normal PCA and localized PCA methods. By implementing so called normal PCA method, the original oscillation behavior of EoS indicated in the framework of 7 bins becomes more significant after the best reconstruction, but such result still supports ΛCDM within the margin of 2σ errors. To further reduce the errors of constraints on EoS, and confirm such deviations from the cosmological constant scenario, we hope for more precise observational data in the future.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921294","page":["1"],"bibcode":"2017APh....86....1Z","identifier":["2017APh....86....1Z","10.1016/j.astropartphys.2016.10.005","10.1016/j.astropartphys.2016.10.005"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Zheng, Wei","Li, Hong"],"aff":["Key Laboratory of Particle Astrophysics, Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Science, P.

A Chree analysis by the superposed epoch method has been done for the study. From the present study we have found that the solar wind speed is a highly effective parameter in producing cosmic ray intensity decreases and geomagnetic storms. No time lag is found between cosmic ray intensity decreases, geomagnetic storms, and peak value of solar wind speed. Further, we have found that the plasma flow pressure is effectively correlated with geomagnetic storms but it is weakly correlated with cosmic ray intensity. The cosmic ray intensity and geomagnetic storms are found to be weakly correlated with plasma density. The decrease in cosmic ray intensity and geomagnetic storms takes place one day after the peak values of plasma flow pressure and plasma density. There is a time lag of one day between solar wind parameters (plasma flow pressure and plasma density) and cosmic ray intensity decrease, geomagnetic storms. Also, we have found a high correlation of cosmic ray intensity and geomagnetic storms with the product of interplanetary magnetic field B and solar wind speed V i.e. B\\cdot V.

In this scenario, the isotropy of expansion is guaranteed considering a triplet of orthogonal vector fields, but the effective mass of the vector field is of the order of the Hubble scale and the inflationary regime is difficult to realize with this model. However, for suitable values (or constraints) of model parameters, it is possible to overcome this issue. In this sense, two cases were analyzed.

The results obtained by numerical solution of the dispersion relation, in a case with isotropic Maxwellian distributions for electrons and PBK distribution for ions, show the occurrence of the electromagnetic ion-cyclotron instability (EMIC), and show that the decrease in the kappa indexes of the PBK ion distribution leads to significant increase in the magnitude of the growth rates and in the range of wavenumber for which the instability occurs. On the other hand, for anisotropic Maxwellian distribution for ions and PBK distribution for electrons, the decrease of the kappa index in the PBK electron distribution contributes to reduce the growth rate of the EMIC instability, but the reduction effect is less pronounced than the increase obtained with ion PBK distribution with the same kappa index. The results obtained also show that, as a general rule, the presence of a dust population contributes to reduce the instability in magnitude of the growth rates and range, but that in the case of PBK ion distribution with small kappa indexes the instability may continue to occur for dust populations which would eliminate completely the instability in the case of bi-Maxwellian ion distributions. It has also been seen that the anisotropy due to the kappa indexes in the ion PBK distribution is not so efficient in producing the EMIC instability as the ratio of perpendicular and parallel ion temperatures, for equivalent value of the effective temperature.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921339","page":["18"],"bibcode":"2017Ap&SS.362...18D","identifier":["2017Ap&SS.362...18D","10.1007/s10509-016-2997-4","10.1007/s10509-016-2997-4"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017: Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","author":["dos Santos, M.

We find the ranges for the magnetic field strength over which the field enhances the halo formation for a mass range for spectral index n<SUB>b</SUB> = -2.95. We found that for field strength less than or equal to B = 7.0 nG, which we call the cut-off field strength, the presence of magnetic field enhances halo formation at low mass scale while it disrupts for a stronger field. We further investigate the dependence of halo count on the spectral index of the magnetic field power spectrum. We observe that at the cut-off field strength, halo formation is disrupted for a spectral index larger than -2.9. We carry out similar investigation for the more generic ellipsoidal collapse where the mass function is given by the Sheth-Tormen formula. For this case we find the cut-off field strength is 5.5 nG.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921375","page":["16"],"bibcode":"2017Ap&SS.362...16V","identifier":["2017Ap&SS.362...16V","10.1007/s10509-016-2995-6","10.1007/s10509-016-2995-6"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017: Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","author":["Varalakshmi, Cheera","Nigam, Rahul"],"aff":["BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus","BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"362","doi":["10.1007/s10509-016-2995-6"],"pub":"Astrophysics and Space Science","keyword":["Magnetic field","Dark matter halo"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["Corrections to halo model in presence of primordial magnetic field"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T22:09:37.618Z"},{"read_count":7,"first_author":"Guo, Jianpo","abstract":"Our Sun will expand enormously and lose substantial mass via a stellar wind during the red giant branch (RGB) phase; the rotational period will be prolonged by several orders of magnitude. It is difficult to predict how much mass the Sun will lose before it reaches the RGB tip. Therefore, the solar rotational period at the RGB tip is also quite indeterminate. In this work, the Sun is considered as a two-component system comprised of a core and a convective envelope, each being allowed to rotate freely. The angular momentum transfer from the inner planets to the solar envelope is taken into consideration. Using Eggleton's stellar evolution code, we study how the solar rotational period at the RGB tip depends on the value of Reimers η chosen. The solar envelope's rotational period at the RGB tip varies from 1 792 to 736 934 years, as the Reimers η is changed from 0.00 to 0.75. Recent observations show that the average Reimers η of Sun-like stars is 0.477. Adopting this average value of the Reimers η, the solar envelope's rotational period at the RGB tip will be 24 868 years. We also show how the envelope's rotational evolves with age and luminosity. Other Sun-like stars, with different planetary configurations, may prematurely eject mass and lead to planetary nebulae, if they engulf a brown-dwarf companion at the RGB tip. Swallowing a planet with 13 Jupiter masses and a 3-day orbit, a Sun-like star can become a rapidly rotating giant star.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921360","page":["15"],"bibcode":"2017Ap&SS.362...15G","identifier":["2017Ap&SS.362...15G","10.1007/s10509-016-2978-7","10.1007/s10509-016-2978-7"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017: Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","author":["Guo, Jianpo","Lin, Ling","Bai, Chunyan","Liu, Jinzhong"],"aff":["School of Science and Technology, Puer University; Open Key Laboratory of Mechanics in Yunnan Province","School of Science and Technology, Puer University","School of Science and Technology, Puer University","Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"362","doi":["10.1007/s10509-016-2978-7"],"pub":"Astrophysics and Space Science","keyword":["Sun: rotation","Stars: mass loss","ISM: planetary nebulae","Planets: hot Jupiter"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["The effects of the Reimers η on the solar rotational period when our Sun evolves to the RGB tip"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-03T13:02:36.901Z"},{"read_count":3,"first_author":"Moeen Moghaddas, M.","abstract":"In this paper, we study the Keplerian, relativistic accretion disks around the non rotating black holes with the bulk viscosity.

Large deviations from isotropy generate kinetic instabilities and growing fluctuating fields which should be more efficient than collisions in limiting the anisotropy (below the instability threshold) and explain the anisotropy limits reported by the observations. The present paper aims to decode the principal instabilities driven by the temperature anisotropy of electrons and protons in the solar wind, and contrast the instability thresholds with the bounds observed at 1 AU for the temperature anisotropy. The instabilities are characterized using linear kinetic theory to identify the appropriate (fastest) instability in the relaxation of temperature anisotropies A_{e,p} = T_{e,p,perp}/ T _{e,p,allel} ≠1.

Our disc model includes the mass influx from a molecular cloud core, the irradiation from the central star, the magnetorotational instability (MRI), and the gravitational instability (Kratter et al. in Astrophys. J. 681:375, 2008). We use the fragmentation criterion of Gammie (Astrophys. J. 553:174, 2001) and Rafikov (Astrophys. J. 621:L69, 2005) to judge whether or not a protostellar disc can fragment. We find that there is a link between whether a protostellar disc can fragment and the properties of the molecular cloud cores (angular velocity ω, temperature T_{core}, and mass M_{core}). In the parameter space ω-M_{core}, there is a critical value ω_{crit}, which divides the parameter space into two regions: one is the fragmentation region, the other is the non-fragmentation region. The protostellar disc can only fragment when ω> ω_{crit}. The reason can be understood as follows. The protostellar disc is formed from the gravitational collapse of a molecular cloud core, the properties of the molecular cloud core determine the properties of the protostellar disc. Thus the two categories of protostellar discs correspond to two categories of molecular cloud cores. Moreover, we find that ω_{crit} is approximately a linear function of M_{core} in log-scale coordinates.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921314","page":["5"],"bibcode":"2017Ap&SS.362....5L","identifier":["2017Ap&SS.362....5L","10.1007/s10509-016-2986-7","10.1007/s10509-016-2986-7"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017: Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","author":["Liu, Chunjian","Li, Min","Yao, Zhen","Mao, Xiaodong"],"aff":["College of Mathematics and Physics, Bohai University","College of Physics, Jilin University","College of Science, Liaoning University of Technology","College of Physics, Jilin University"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"362","doi":["10.1007/s10509-016-2986-7"],"pub":"Astrophysics and Space Science","keyword":["Planets and satellites: formation","Hydrodynamics","Instabilities","Protostellar discs"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["The ability of a protostellar disc to fragment and the properties of molecular cloud cores"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T21:50:09.008Z"},{"read_count":0,"first_author":"Etim, Emmanuel E.","abstract":"Linear carbon chain molecular species remain the dominant theme in interstellar chemistry. Their continuous astronomical observation depends on the availability of accurate spectroscopic parameters. Accurate rotational constants are reported for hundreds of molecular species of astrophysical, spectroscopy and chemical interests from the different linear carbon chains; C_{{n}}H, C_{{n}}H<SUP>-</SUP>, C_{{n}}N, C_{{n}}N<SUP>-</SUP>, C_{{n}}O, C_{{n}}S, HC_{{n}}S, C_{{n}}Si, CH<SUB>3</SUB>(CC)_{{n}}H, HC_{{n}}N, DC_{2{n}+1}N, HC_{2{n}}NC, and CH<SUB>3</SUB>(C≡C)_{{n}}CN using three to four moments of inertia calculated from the experimental rotational constants coupled with those obtained from the optimized geometries at the Hartree Fock level. The calculated rotational constants are obtained from the corrected moments of inertia at the Hartfree Fock geometries. The calculated rotational constants show accuracy of few kHz below irrespective of the chain length and terminating groups. The obtained accuracy of few kHz places these rotational constants as excellent tools for both astronomical and laboratory detection of these molecular species of astrophysical interest. From the numerous unidentified lines from different astronomical surveys, transitions corresponding to known and new linear carbon chains could be found using these rotational constants. The astrophysical, spectroscopic and chemical implications of these results are discussed.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921320","page":["4"],"bibcode":"2017Ap&SS.362....4E","identifier":["2017Ap&SS.362....4E","10.1007/s10509-016-2979-6","10.1007/s10509-016-2979-6"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017: Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht","author":["Etim, Emmanuel E.","Arunan, Elangannan"],"aff":["Inorganic and Physical Chemistry Department, Indian Institute of Science; Department of Chemical Sciences, Federal University","Inorganic and Physical Chemistry Department, Indian Institute of Science"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"362","doi":["10.1007/s10509-016-2979-6"],"pub":"Astrophysics and Space Science","keyword":["Astrochemistry","Molecules","Carbon chains","Spectroscopy","Rotational constants"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["Accurate rotational constants for linear interstellar carbon chains: achieving experimental accuracy"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T23:53:17.132Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161108704S"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161108704S","2017Ap&SS.362....3S","10.1007/s10509-016-2990-y","2016arXiv161108704S","1611.08704","10.1007/s10509-016-2990-y"],"first_author":"Su, Renzhi","abstract":"The correlation between the jet power and accretion disk luminosity is investigated and analyzed with our model for 7 samples of low luminosity active galactic nuclei (LLAGNs).

In particular, we discuss a physical criterion that restricts to a unique possibility (up to unitary equivalence) the infinite set of available vacua. We prove that this desired uniqueness is guaranteed, for any possible choice of spin structure on the spatial sections, if we impose two conditions. The first one is that the symmetries of the classical system must be implemented quantum mechanically, so that the vacuum is invariant under the symmetry transformations. The second and more important condition is that the constructed theory must have a quantum dynamics that is implementable as a (non-trivial) unitary operator in Fock space. Actually, this unitarity of the quantum dynamics leads us to identify as explicitly time dependent some very specific contributions of the Dirac field. In doing that, we essentially characterize the part of the dynamics governed by the Dirac equation that is unitarily implementable. The uniqueness of the Fock vacuum is attained then once a physically motivated convention for the concepts of particles and antiparticles is fixed.","read_count":11,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"23252196","page":["76"],"bibcode":"2017AnPhy.376...76C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier Inc.","author":["Cortez, Jerónimo","Elizaga Navascués, Beatriz","Martín-Benito, Mercedes","Mena Marugán, Guillermo A.","Velhinho, José M."],"aff":["Departamento de Física, Facultad de Ciencias, Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, México D.F. 04510, Mexico","Instituto de Estructura de la Materia, IEM-CSIC, Serrano 121, 28006 Madrid, Spain","Radboud University Nijmegen, Institute for Mathematics, Astrophysics and Particle Physics, Heyendaalseweg 135, NL-6525 AJ Nijmegen, The Netherlands","Instituto de Estructura de la Materia, IEM-CSIC, Serrano 121, 28006 Madrid, Spain","Universidade da Beira Interior, Rua Marquês d'Ávila e Bolama, 6201-001, Covilhã, Portugal"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"376","doi":["10.1016/j.aop.2016.11.005"],"pub":"Annals of Physics","keyword":["Quantum field theory in curved spacetimes","Fock quantization","Uniqueness criteria","Unitarity in cosmological backgrounds","General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsB.

Here, features of the signal visible in the data are analyzed using concepts from Newtonian physics and general relativity, accessible to anyone with a general physics background. The simple analysis presented here is consistent with the fully general-relativistic analyses published elsewhere,in showing that the signal was produced by the inspiral and subsequent merger of two black holes. The black holes were each of approximately 35 Msun, still orbited each other as close as ~350 km apart, and subsequently merged to form a single black hole. Similar reasoning, directly from the data, is used to roughly estimate how far these black holes were from the Earth, and the energy that they radiated in gravitational waves.","read_count":525,"citation_count":11,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"23252423","page":["1600209"],"bibcode":"2017AnP...52900209A","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Abbott, B.

To fully exploit the unique photometric and astrometric data, stored on the plates, further processing steps are required including registering the plate to celestial coordinates, masking of the plates, and a calibration of the photo-emulsion darkening curve. To demonstrate the correct functioning of these procedures, historical light curves of two bright BL Lac type active galactic nuclei are extracted. The resulting light curve of the blazar 1ES 1215+303 exhibits a large decrease in the magnitude from $14.25^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ to $15.94^{+0.09}_{-0.13}$ in about 300 days, which proves the variability in the optical region.

Conversely, during the rise towards the following maximum, these observed absorption features had returned to lower expansion velocities.We found that the absorption features of some Fe II lines displayed the same behaviour, but in addition disappeared for a few days during some declining phases. Features of several N I lines also disappeared while new N II lines appeared in emission for a few days during some of the declining phases of the light curve of Nova V5668 Sgr.

Within an observing time span of 4 years we detected 150 flares in Kepler data in an energy range of $10^{36} - 10^{37}$ erg. From a dynamical Lomb-Scargle periodogram we have evidence for differential rotation as well as for stellar spot evolution and migration. Analysing the occurrence times of the flares we found hints for a periodic flare frequency cycle of $430 - 460 $d, the significance increases with an increasing threshold of the flares equivalent duration. One explanation is a very short activity cycle of the star with that period. Another possibility, also proposed by others in similar cases, is that the larger flares may be triggered by external phenomena, such as magnetically interaction with an unseen companion. Our high resolution spectra show that KIC011764567 is not a short period binary star.","read_count":22,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921035","page":["49"],"bibcode":"2017AN....338...49K","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kitze, M.","Akopian, A.

After a detailed discussion of the dating of the observation, we show that the text specifies that the transient celestial object was stationary and/or tail-less (\"a star among the stars\"), that it \"remained for close to three months getting fainter and fainter until it disappeared\", that it \"threw out sparks\", i.e. it was scintillating and very bright, and that the color changed with time. The information content is consistent with the other Arabic and non-Arabic reports about SN 1006. Hence, it is quite clear that Ibn Sina refers to SN 1006 in his report, given as an example for transient celestial objects in a discussion of Aristotle's \"Meteorology\".

We searched for additional evidences from other areas like East Asia and Europe. We found that the date given by al-Yamani is fully consistent with other evidence, including: (a) SN 1006 \"rose several times half an hour after sunset\" (al-Yamani), which is correct for the location of Sana in Yemen for the time around Apr 17, but it would not be correct for late Apr or early May; (b) the date (3rd year, 3rd lunar month, 28th day wuzi, Ichidai Yoki) for an observation of a guest star in Japan is inconsistent (there is no day wuzi in that lunar month), but may be dated to Apr 16 by reading wuwu date rather than a wuzi date; (c) there is observational evidence that SN 1006 was observed in East Asia early or mid April; for the second half of April, a bad weather (early monsoon) period is not unlikely -- there is a lack of night reports; (d) the observer in St. Gallen reported to have seen SN 1006 \"for three months\", which must have ended at the very latest on AD 1006 Jul 10, given his northern location, so that his observations probably started in April.

To test whether this difference reflects mass segregation in Taurus or a variation in the initial mass function, we have performed a survey for members of Taurus across a large field (̃40 deg<SUP>2</SUP>) that was imaged by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We obtained optical and near-infrared spectra of candidate members identified with those images and the Two Micron All Sky Survey, as well as miscellaneous candidates that were selected with several other diagnostics of membership. We have classified 22 of the candidates as new members of Taurus, which includes one of the coolest known members (M9.75). Our updated census of members within the SDSS field shows a surplus of solar-mass stars relative to clusters, although it is less pronounced than in the smaller fields toward the stellar aggregates that were surveyed for previously measured mass functions in Taurus. In addition to spectra of our new members, we include in our study near-IR spectra of roughly half of the known members of Taurus, which are used to refine their spectral types and extinctions. We also present an updated set of near-IR standard spectra for classifying young stars and brown dwarfs at M and L types.

Here, we present a new image of the third inner disk component of HD 141569 A made in the L′ band (3.8 μm) during the commissioning of the vector vortex coronagraph that has recently been installed in the near-infrared imager and spectrograph NIRC2 behind the W.M. Keck Observatory Keck II adaptive optics system. We used reference point-spread function subtraction, which reveals the innermost disk component from the inner working distance of ≃23 au and up to ≃70 au. The spatial scale of our detection roughly corresponds to the optical and near-infrared scattered light, thermal Q, N, and 8.6 μm PAH emission reported earlier. We also see an outward progression in dust location from the L′ band to the H band (Very Large Telescope/SPHERE image) to the visible (Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/STIS image), which is likely indicative of dust blowout. The warm disk component is nested deep inside the two outer belts imaged by HST-NICMOS in 1999 (at 406 and 245 au, respectively). We fit our new L′-band image and spectral energy distribution of HD 141569 A with the radiative transfer code MCFOST. Our best-fit models favor pure olivine grains and are consistent with the composition of the outer belts. While our image shows a putative very faint point-like clump or source embedded in the inner disk, we did not detect any true companion within the gap between the inner disk and the first outer ring, at a sensitivity of a few Jupiter masses.","citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921538","page":["44"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...44M","bibgroup":["Keck","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mawet, Dimitri","Choquet, Élodie","Absil, Olivier","Huby, Elsa","Bottom, Michael","Serabyn, Eugene","Femenia, Bruno","Lebreton, Jérémy","Matthews, Keith","Gomez Gonzalez, Carlos A.","Wertz, Olivier","Carlomagno, Brunella","Christiaens, Valentin","Defrère, Denis","Delacroix, Christian","Forsberg, Pontus","Habraken, Serge","Jolivet, Aissa","Karlsson, Mikael","Milli, Julien","Pinte, Christophe","Piron, Pierre","Reggiani, Maddalena","Surdej, Jean","Vargas Catalan, Ernesto"],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, California Institute of Technology, 1200 East California Boulevard, MC 249-17, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA;","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA;","Space sciences, Technologies and Astrophysics Research (STAR) Institute, Université de Liège, 19 Allée du Six Août, B-4000 Liège, Belgium;","Space sciences, Technologies and Astrophysics Research (STAR) Institute, Université de Liège, 19 Allée du Six Août, B-4000 Liège, Belgium;","Department of Astronomy, California Institute of Technology, 1200 East California Boulevard, MC 249-17, Pasadena, CA 91125 USA; Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA","W.

There is an apparent excess of single-transit planet systems that cannot be explained by transit geometries alone, when a single planetary mutual inclination dispersion is assumed. This suggests that the observed compact planetary systems have at least two different architectures. We present a scenario where the “Kepler dichotomy” may be explained by the action of an external giant planet or stellar companion misaligned with the inner multi-planet system. The external companion excites mutual inclinations of the inner planets, causing such systems to appear as “Kepler singles” in transit surveys. We derive approximate analytic expressions (in various limiting regimes), calibrated with numerical calculations, for the mutual inclination excitations for various planetary systems and perturber properties (mass m<SUB>p</SUB>, semimajor axis a<SUB>p</SUB>, and inclination {θ }<SUB>p</SUB>). In general, the excited mutual inclination increases with {m}<SUB>p</SUB>/{a}<SUB>p</SUB><SUP>3</SUP> and {θ }<SUB>p</SUB>, though secular resonances may lead to large mutual inclinations even for small {θ }<SUB>p</SUB>.

We identify dozens of starspot-crossing events, when the planet eclipses a relatively dark region of the stellar photosphere. The observed patterns of these events demonstrate that the planet always transits over the same range of stellar latitudes and, therefore, that the stellar obliquity is less than about 10°. We support this conclusion with two different modeling approaches: one based on explicit identification and timing of the events and the other based on fitting the light curves with a spotted-star model. We refine the transit parameters and measure the stellar rotation period (18.5 ± 1.9 days), which corresponds to a “gyrochronological” age of 1.4 ± 0.3 Gyr. Coherent flux variations with the same period as the transits are well modeled as the combined effects of ellipsoidal light variations (15.4 ± 4.8 ppm) and Doppler boosting (14.6 ± 5.1 ppm). The magnitudes of these effects correspond to a planetary mass of 2.6+/- 0.9 {M}<SUB>{Jup</SUB>} and 3.9+/- 1.5 {M}<SUB>{Jup</SUB>}, respectively. Both of these independent mass estimates agree with the mass determined by the spectroscopic Doppler technique (2.487+/- 0.086 {M}<SUB>{Jup</SUB>}).

We have created the first ever full-sky set of coadds combining all publicly available W1 and W2 exposures from both the AllWISE and NEOWISE-Reactivation (NEOWISER) mission phases. We employ an adaptation of the unWISE image coaddition framework, which preserves the native WISE angular resolution and is optimized for forced photometry. By incorporating two additional scans of the entire sky, we not only improve the W1/W2 depths, but also largely eliminate time-dependent artifacts such as off-axis scattered moonlight. We anticipate that our new coadds will have a broad range of applications, including target selection for upcoming spectroscopic cosmology surveys, identification of distant/massive galaxy clusters, and discovery of high-redshift quasars. In particular, our full-depth AllWISE+NEOWISER coadds will be an important input for the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument selection of luminous red galaxy and quasar targets. Our full-depth W1/W2 coadds are already in use within the DECam Legacy Survey (DECaLS) and Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) reduction pipelines.

Researchers use them to establish the extragalactic distance scale, to underpin estimates of the Hubble constant, and to study peculiar velocities induced by gravitational attractions that perturb the motions of galaxies with respect to the “Hubble flow” of universal expansion. In 2006 the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) began making available a comprehensive compilation of redshift-independent extragalactic distance estimates. A decade later, this compendium of distances (NED-D) now contains more than 100,000 individual estimates based on primary and secondary indicators, available for more than 28,000 galaxies, and compiled from over 2000 references in the refereed astronomical literature. This paper describes the methodology, content, and use of NED-D, and addresses challenges to be overcome in compiling such distances. Currently, 75 different distance indicators are in use. We include a figure that facilitates comparison of the indicators with significant numbers of estimates in terms of the minimum, 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum distances spanned.

In particular, those that are components of multiple systems can help us solve the problem of the formation of these systems. Analysis of the radial velocities together with the light curve produced for the first time precise physical parameters of the components of the multiple systems V773 Cas, QS Aql, and BR Ind. Their visual orbits were also analyzed, which resulted in slightly improved orbital elements. What is typical for all these systems is that their most dominant source is the third distant component. The system V773 Cas consists of two similar G1-2V stars revolving in a circular orbit and a more distant component of the A3V type. Additionally, the improved value of parallax was calculated to be 17.6 mas. Analysis of QS Aql resulted in the following: the inner eclipsing pair is composed of B6V and F1V stars, and the third component is of about the B6 spectral type. The outer orbit has high eccentricity of about 0.95, and observations near its upcoming periastron passage between the years 2038 and 2040 are of high importance. Also, the parallax of the system was derived to be about 2.89 mas, moving the star much closer to the Sun than originally assumed.

We generated secondary eclipse light curves of the planet in both blended white-light and spectrally binned wavechannels from 1.1 {to} 1.7 μ {{m}} and corrected the light curves for flux contamination from a nearby companion star. We modeled the detector systematics and secondary eclipse spectrum using Gaussian process regression and found that the near-IR emission spectrum of WASP-103b is featureless across the observed near-IR region to down to a sensitivity of 175 ppm, and shows a shallow slope toward the red. The atmosphere has a single brightness temperature of {T}<SUB>{{B</SUB>}}=2890 K across this wavelength range. This region of the spectrum is indistinguishable from isothermal, but may not manifest from a physically isothermal system, I.e., pseudo-isothermal. A solar-metallicity profile with a thermal inversion layer at 10<SUP>-2</SUP> bar fits the spectrum of WASP-103b with high confidence, as do an isothermal profile with solar metallicity and a monotonically decreasing atmosphere with C/O > 1. The data rule out a monotonically decreasing atmospheric profile with solar composition, and we rule out a low-metallicity decreasing profile as unphysical for this system. The pseudo-isothermal profile could be explained by a thermal inversion layer just above the layer probed by our observations, or by clouds or haze in the upper atmosphere.

To find additional observables caused by this scenario, we present here the first detailed emplacement simulation in the presence of a massive ninth planet on the distant Kuiper Belt. We perform 4 Gyr N-body simulations with the currently known solar system planetary architecture, plus a 10 M<SUB>⊕</SUB> planet with similar orbital parameters to those suggested by Trujillo & Sheppard or Batygin & Brown, and 10<SUP>5</SUP> test particles in an initial planetesimal disk. We find that including a distant super-Earth-mass planet produces a substantially different orbital distribution for the scattering and detached TNOs, raising the pericenters and inclinations of moderate semimajor axis (50 < a < 500 au) objects. We test whether this signature is detectable via a simulator with the observational characteristics of four precisely characterized TNO surveys. We find that the qualitatively very distinct solar system models that include a ninth planet are essentially observationally indistinguishable from an outer solar system produced solely by the four giant planets. We also find that the mass of the Kuiper Belt’s current scattering and detached populations is required to be 3-10 times larger in the presence of an additional planet. We do not find any evidence for clustering of orbital angles in our simulated TNO population. Wide-field, deep surveys targeting inclined high-pericenter objects will be required to distinguish between these different scenarios.","read_count":53,"citation_count":14,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921603","page":["33"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...33L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Lawler, S.

In particular, the possibility is emphasized that the slight bump in the integrated continuum of this remnant around 20-70 GHz is genuine and that it can be explained by the contribution of an additional emission mechanism such as spinning dust. We find that adding a spinning dust component to the emission model improves the fit of the integrated spectrum of this SNR while at the same time preserving the physically probable parameter values.

The Rosetta spacecraft MAGnetometer (MAG) instrument observations near perihelion showed crossing events into a magnetic field-free region at about 170 km from the nucleus in 2015 July at 1.26 au from the Sun. At each crossing, the magnitude of the magnetic field dropped by more than 20 nT to near zero. We compared the Ion and Electron Sensor (IES) electron differential flux energy spectrum inside and outside the crossing boundaries. The IES observations show a modest but consistent drop in electron flux for energies between 40 eV and a few hundred eV at each cavity crossing event. This drop in the electron spectra might be due to the absence or attenuation of solar wind electrons inside the observed diamagnetic regions, which might or might not be a diamagnetic cavity. There is no apparent simple linear correlation between the electron count rate measured by the IES at different energies and the magnitude of the magnetic field, however; at all energies, the highest electron count rates are recorded at the highest magnetic field magnitudes. From model-data comparisons it seems that inside diamagnetic regions, pure coma photoelectrons are not sufficient to explain the observations and that a trapping mechanism and/or infused solar wind electrons are necessary to explain the observed electron fluxes.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921558","page":["30"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...30M","identifier":["2017AJ....153...30M","10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/30","10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/30"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Madanian, H.","Cravens, T.

Radar observations have indicated the significant presence of metal on the surface with a small percentage of silicates. Prior ground-based observations showed rotational variations in the near-infrared (NIR) spectra and radar albedo of this asteroid. However, no comprehensive study that combines multi-wavelength data has been conducted so far. Here we present rotationally resolved NIR spectra (0.7-2.5 μm) of (16) Psyche obtained with the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility. These data have been combined with shape models of the asteroid for each rotation phase. Spectral band parameters extracted from the NIR spectra show that the pyroxene band center varies from ̃0.92 to 0.94 μm. Band center values were used to calculate the pyroxene chemistry of the asteroid, whose average value was found to be Fs<SUB>30</SUB>En<SUB>65</SUB>Wo<SUB>5</SUB>. Variations in the band depth (BD) were also observed, with values ranging from 1.0% to 1.5%. Using a new laboratory spectral calibration method, we estimated an average orthopyroxene content of 6% ± 1%. The mass-deficit region of Psyche, which exhibits the highest radar albedo, also shows the highest value for the spectral slope and the minimum BD. The spectral characteristics of Psyche suggest that its parent body did not have the typical structure expected for a differentiated body or that the sequence of events that led to its current state was more complex than previously thought.","read_count":46,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921597","page":["29"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...29S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Sanchez, Juan A.","Reddy, Vishnu","Shepard, Michael K.","Thomas, Cristina","Cloutis, Edward A.","Takir, Driss","Conrad, Albert","Kiddell, Cain","Applin, Daniel"],"aff":["Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, AZ 85719, USA;;","Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA;","Bloomsburg University, Bloomsburg, PA 17815, USA","Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, AZ 85719, USA;","Department of Geography, University of Winnipeg, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","Astrogeology Science Center, U.S. Geological Survey, Flagstaff, AZ 86001, USA;","LBT Observatory, University of Arizona, Tucson, AZ 85721, USA","Department of Geography, University of Winnipeg, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada","Department of Geography, University of Winnipeg, Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada"],"orcid_pub":["-","0000-0002-7743-3491","-","-","0000-0001-7301-0929","-","0000-0003-2872-0061","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/29"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:1"],"keyword":["minor planets","asteroids: general","techniques: spectroscopic","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis research work was supported by NASA Planetary Mission Data Analysis Program Grant NNX13AP27G, NASA NEOO Program Grant NNX12AG12G, and NASA Planetary Geology and Geophysics Program Grant NNX11AN84G.

The observed data are corrected for systematic errors according to the coarse de-correlation and SYSREM algorithms, so as to enhance the signal of the transit events. In order to consistently model the star spots and transits of this exoplanetary system, we develop a highly efficient tool STMT based on the analytic models of Mandel & Agol and Montalto et al. The physical parameters of HAT-P-20 are refined by homogeneously analyzing our new data, the radial velocity data, and the earlier photometric data in the literature with the Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. New radii and masses of both host star and planet are larger than those in the discovery paper due to the discrepancy of the radius among K-dwarfs between predicted values by standard stellar models and empirical calibration from observations. Through the analysis of all available mid-transit times calculated with the normal model and spotted model, we conclude that the periodic transit timing variations in these transit events revealed by employing the normal model are probably induced by spot crossing events. From the analysis of the distribution of occulted spots by HAT-P-20b, we constrain the misaligned architecture between the planetary orbit and the spin of the host star.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921533","page":["28"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...28S","identifier":["2017AJ....153...28S","10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/28","10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/28"],"bibgroup":["Keck"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Sun, Leilei","Gu, Shenghong","Wang, Xiaobin","Collier Cameron, Andrew","Cao, Dongtao","Wang, Yibo","Xiang, Yue","Hui, Ho-Keung","Kwok, Chi-Tai","Yeung, Bill","Ng, Eric","Grau Horta, Ferran"],"aff":["Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China;","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China","School of Physics and Astronomy, University of St Andrews, North Haugh, St Andrews, Fife KY16 9SS, UK","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China","Yunnan Observatories, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China; Key Laboratory for the Structure and Evolution of Celestial Objects, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Kunming 650011, China","Ho Koon Nature Education cum Astronomical Centre, Sik Sik Yuen, Hong Kong, China","Ho Koon Nature Education cum Astronomical Centre, Sik Sik Yuen, Hong Kong, China","Hong Kong Astronomical Society, Hong Kong, China","Hong Kong Astronomical Society, Hong Kong, China","Observatori Ca l’Ou, C/de Dalt 18, Sant Martí Sesgueioles, Spain"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-6631-8770","-","-","-","0000-0002-3534-1740","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/28"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:4"],"keyword":["planetary systems","stars: individual: HAT-P-20","techniques: photometric"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the staff of the 1 m and 2.4 m telescopes of Yunnan Observatories, the 0.5 m telescope of Ho koon Nature Education cum Astronomical Centre, and Observatori Ca l’Ou for supporting our observations.

We find that the dynamics of the giant planets can be decomposed into a classic Lagrange-Laplace dynamics relative to their own invariant plane and a slow precession of said plane relative to the total angular momentum vector of the solar system, including planet 9. Under specific configurations for planet 9, this precession can explain the current tilt of ̃6° between the invariant plane of the giant planets and the solar equator. An analytical model is developed to map the evolution of the inclination of the inner giant planets’ invariant plane as a function of the planet 9's mass and orbital elements, and numerical simulations of the equations of motion are performed to validate our analytical approach. The longitude of the ascending node of planet 9 is found to be linked to the longitude of the ascending node of the giant planets’ invariant plane, which also constrains the longitude of the node of planet 9 on the ecliptic. Some of the planet 9 configurations that allow the explanation of the current solar tilt are compatible with those proposed to explain the orbital confinement of distant Kuiper Belt objects. This work gives an elegant explanation for the current tilt between the invariant plane of the inner giant planets and the solar equator and also adds new constraints to the orbital elements of planet 9.","read_count":110,"citation_count":14,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921552","page":["27"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...27G","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Gomes, Rodney","Deienno, Rogerio","Morbidelli, Alessandro"],"aff":["Observatório Nacional Rua General José Cristino 77, CEP 20921-400, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","Laboratoire Lagrange, UCA, OCA, CNRS, Nice, France ; Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais, São José dos Campos, SP, Brazil","Laboratoire Lagrange, UMR7293, Université Côte dAzur, CNRS, Observatoire de la Côte dAzur, France"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-5712-3042","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/27"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","keyword":["celestial mechanics","planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability","Sun: general","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nR.D. acknowledges support provided by grants #2015/18682-6 and #2014/02013-5, São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) and CAPES.\nAfter the submission of this paper, we learned that Bailey et al.

GMOSS invokes different physical components and associated radiative processes to describe the sky spectrum over 3072 pixels of 5° resolution. The spectra are allowed to be convex, concave, or of more complex form with contributions from synchrotron emission, thermal emission, and free-free absorption included. Physical parameters that describe the model are optimized to best fit four all-sky maps at 150 MHz, 408 MHz, 1420 MHz, and 23 GHz and two maps at 22 and 45 MHz generated using the Global Sky Model of de Oliveira-Costa et al. The fractional deviation of the model from data has a median value of 6% and is less than 17% for 99% of the pixels. Though aimed at the modeling of foregrounds for the global signal arising from the redshifted 21 cm line of hydrogen during the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), over redshifts 150≲ z≲ 6, GMOSS is well suited for any application that requires simulating spectra of the low-frequency radio sky as would be observed by the beam of any instrument. The complexity in spectral structure that naturally arises from the underlying physics of the model provides a useful expectation for departures from smoothness in EoR foreground spectra and hence may guide the development of algorithms for EoR signal detection. This aspect is further explored in a subsequent paper.","read_count":43,"citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921523","page":["26"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...26S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Sathyanarayana Rao, Mayuri","Subrahmanyan, Ravi","Udaya Shankar, N.","Chluba, Jens"],"aff":["Raman Research Institute, C V Raman Avenue, Sadashivanagar, Bangalore 560080, India; Australian National University, Research School for Astronomy & Astrophysics, Mount Stromlo Observatory, Cotter Road, Weston, ACT 2611, Australia;","Raman Research Institute, C V Raman Avenue, Sadashivanagar, Bangalore 560080, India","Raman Research Institute, C V Raman Avenue, Sadashivanagar, Bangalore 560080, India","Jodrell Bank Centre for Astrophysics, University of Manchester, Oxford Road, M13 9PL, UK"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/26"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:1"],"keyword":["cosmic background radiation","cosmology: observations","ISM: general","methods: data analysis","methods: observational","radio continuum: general","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe acknowledge the use of the Legacy Archive for Microwave Background Data Analysis (LAMBDA), part of the High Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Center (HEASARC).

Once again, Phaethon brightened by ̃2 mag soon after its perihelion passage, contradicting expectations from the phase function of a macroscopic monolithic body. Subsequently, a short antisolar tail of ̃0.°1 in length was formed within ̃1 day and quickly disappeared. No trail was seen. Our syndyne-synchrone analysis indicates that the tail was comprised of submicron to micron particles and can be approximated by a synchrone coinciding with the outburst. We estimate that the outburst has released a mass of ̃10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> kg, comparable to the two mass ejections in 2009 and 2012, and that the average mass-loss rate is ̃0.1-1 kg s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The forward-scattering effect hinted at low level activity of Phaethon prior to the outburst, which increased the effective cross section by merely ≲1 km<SUP>2</SUP>. Without the forward-scattering enhancement, detecting such activity at side-scattering phase angles is very difficult. The forward-scattering effect also reinforces the idea that the ejected dust grains rather than gas emissions were responsible for the activity of Phaethon. Despite Phaethon's reactivation, it is highly unlikely that the Geminid meteoroid stream can be sustained by similar perihelion mass-loss events.","read_count":153,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921563","page":["23"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...23H","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Hui, Man-To","Li, Jing"],"aff":["Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, UCLA, 595 Charles Young Drive East, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1567, USA","Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, UCLA, 595 Charles Young Drive East, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1567, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-9067-7477","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/23"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","keyword":["methods: data analysis","minor planets","asteroids: general","asteroids: individual: 3200","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank amateur astronomers who reported the abnormal activity of Phaethon in the Yahoo mailing list, where we were alerted, and David Jewitt, Henry Hsieh, and Paul Wiegert for valuable discussions.

Significant intrapixel sensitivity variations in Spitzer IRAC data require careful correction in order to achieve precision on the order of several hundred parts per million (ppm) for the measurement of exoplanet secondary eclipses. We determine eclipse depths by first correcting the raw data using three independent data reduction methods. The Pixel Gain Map (PMAP), Nearest Neighbors (NNBR), and Pixel Level Decorrelation (PLD) each correct for the intrapixel sensitivity effect in Spitzer photometric time-series observations. The results from each methodology are compared against each other to establish if they reach a statistically equivalent result in every case and to evaluate their ability to minimize uncertainty in the measurement. We find that all three methods produce reliable results. For every planet examined here NNBR and PLD produce results that are in statistical agreement. However, the PMAP method appears to produce results in slight disagreement in cases where the stellar centroid is not kept consistently on the most well characterized area of the detector. We evaluate the ability of each method to reduce the scatter in the residuals as well as in the correlated noise in the corrected data. The NNBR and PLD methods consistently minimize both white and red noise levels and should be considered reliable and consistent. The planets in this study span equilibrium temperatures from 1100 to 2000 K and have brightness temperatures that require either high albedo or efficient recirculation. However, it is possible that other processes such as clouds or disequilibrium chemistry may also be responsible for producing these brightness temperatures.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921566","page":["22"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...22K","bibgroup":["Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kilpatrick, Brian M.","Lewis, Nikole K.","Kataria, Tiffany","Deming, Drake","Ingalls, James G.","Krick, Jessica E.","Tucker, Gregory S."],"aff":["Department of Physics, Box 1843, Brown University, Providence, RI 02904, USA","Space Telescope Science Institute, Baltimore, MD 21218, USA","Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA 91109, USA","Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland, College Park, MD 20742, USA","Spitzer Science Center, Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, California Institute of Technology, Mail Code 220-6, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA","Spitzer Science Center, Infrared Processing and Analysis Center, California Institute of Technology, Mail Code 220-6, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA","Department of Physics, Box 1843, Brown University, Providence, RI 02904, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-4220-600X","-","-","-","0000-0003-4714-1364","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/22"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:11"],"keyword":["atmospheric effects","methods: numerical","planets and satellites: atmospheres","planets and satellites: detection","techniques: photometric","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nBMK acknowledges Brown University for its financial support of his contributions to this work.

The α, iron-peak, and Period 5 transition metal abundances for these stars show a modest enhancement over solar averaging about 0.05 dex. The lanthanides are more abundant, averaging about +0.2 dex over solar. The question is: Are these stars enhanced, or is the Sun somewhat metal-poor relative to these stars? The consistency of the abundances derived here supports an argument for the latter view. Lithium, carbon, and oxygen abundances have been derived. The stars show the usual lithium astration as a function of mass/temperature. There are more than 100 planet-hosts in the sample, and there is no discernible difference in their lithium content, relative to the remaining stars.

The new survey also adds super-solar metallicity open cluster NGC 6791 to increase the metallicity diversity. The combined survey provides a homogeneous 5-band data set that can be used to pursue a broad range of scientific investigations. In particular, the chosen UV filters allow the identification of multiple stellar populations by targeting the regions of the spectrum that are sensitive to abundance variations in C, N, and O. In order to provide the community with uniform preliminary catalogs, we have devised an automated procedure that performs high-quality photometry on the new UV observations (along with similar observations of seven other programs in the archive). This procedure finds and measures the potential sources on each individual exposure using library point-spread functions and cross-correlates these observations with the original ACS-Survey catalog. The catalog of 57 clusters we publish here will be useful to identify stars in the different stellar populations, in particular for spectroscopic follow-up. Eventually, we will construct a more sophisticated catalog and artificial-star tests based on an optimal reduction of the UV survey data, but the catalogs presented here give the community the chance to make early use of this HST Treasury survey.","citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921545","page":["19"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...19S","bibgroup":["HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Soto, M.","Bellini, A.","Anderson, J.","Piotto, G.","Bedin, L.

We divide these into two groups according to their proximity to exact resonance. Proximity is measured by the existence of a separatrix in phase space. MMRs between Io-Europa, Europa-Ganymede, and Enceladus-Dione are too distant from exact resonance for a separatrix to appear. A separatrix is present only in the phase spaces of the Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion MMRs, and their resonant arguments are the only ones to exhibit substantial librations. Could there be a causal connection between the libration amplitude and the presence of a separatrix? Our suspicions were aroused by Goldreich & Schlichting, who demonstrate that sufficiently deep in a MMR, eccentricity damping could destabilize librations. However, our investigation reveals that libration amplitudes in both the Mimas-Tethys and Titan-Hyperion MMRs are fossils. Although the Mimas-Tethys MMR is overstable, its libration amplitude grows on the tidal damping timescale of Mimas’s inclination, which is considerably longer than a Hubble time. On the other hand, the Titan-Hyperion MMR is stable, but tidal damping of Hyperion’s eccentricity is too weak to have affected the amplitude of its libration.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14921516","page":["17"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...17L","identifier":["2017AJ....153...17L","10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/17","10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/17"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Luan, Jing","Goldreich, Peter"],"aff":["University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, USA","California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, USA"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-6048-1959","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/17"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","keyword":["planets and satellites: dynamical evolution and stability"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the anonymous referee who provided valuable comments and questions, which helped us to greatly improve the paper.

With the advent of optical interferometry, there is a need for suitably bright, well-vetted calibrator stars over a large portion of the sky. We present a catalog of uniformly computed angular diameters for 1510 stars in the northern hemisphere, brighter than V = 6 and with declinations -15^\\circ < δ < 82^\\circ . The median angular stellar diameter is 0.529 mas. The list has been carefully cleansed of all known binary and multiple stellar systems. We derive the angular diameters for each of the stars by fitting spectral templates to the observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from literature fluxes. We compare these derived angular diameters against those measured by optical interferometry for 75 of the stars, as well as to 176 diameter estimates from previous calibrator catalogs, finding in general excellent agreement. The final catalog includes our goodness-of-fit metrics as well as an online atlas of our SED fits. The catalog presented here permits selection of the best calibrator stars for current and future visible-light interferometric observations.","read_count":25,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921560","page":["16"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...16S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Swihart, Samuel J.","Garcia, E.

This system was initially reported as a planetary candidate based on two transit events seen in K2 Campaign 1 photometry and later validated as an exoplanet candidate. We confirm the transit and refine the ephemeris with two subsequent ground-based detections of the transit using the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope 1 m telescope network. We rule out any transit timing variations above the level of ̃30 s. Using high precision radial velocity measurements from HARPS and SOPHIE we identify the transiting companion as a brown dwarf with a mass, radius, and bulk density of 66.9 ± 1.7 M<SUB>J</SUB>, 0.757 ± 0.065 R<SUB>J</SUB>, and 191 ± 51 g cm<SUP>-3</SUP> respectively. EPIC 201702477b is the smallest radius brown dwarf yet discovered, with a mass just below the H-burning limit. It has the highest density of any planet, substellar mass object, or main-sequence star discovered so far. We find evidence in the set of known transiting brown dwarfs for two populations of objects—high mass brown dwarfs and low mass brown dwarfs. The higher-mass population have radii in very close agreement to theoretical models, and show a lower-mass limit around 60 M<SUB>J</SUB>. This may be the signature of mass-dependent ejection of systems during the formation process.","citation_count":9,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921528","page":["15"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...15B","bibgroup":["Keck","ESO/Telescopes","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Bayliss, D.","Hojjatpanah, S.","Santerne, A.","Dragomir, D.","Zhou, G.","Shporer, A.","Colón, K.

However, when trying to observe Earth analogs, it is often difficult to test the veracity of detection. We have developed a new approach to the analysis of exoplanetary spectral observations based on temporal multifractality, which identifies timescales that characterize planetary orbital motion around the host star and those that arise from stellar features such as spots. Without fitting stellar models to spectral data, we show how the planetary signal can be robustly detected from noisy data using noise amplitude as a source of information. For observation of transiting planets, combining this method with simple geometry allows us to relate the timescales obtained to primary and secondary eclipse of the exoplanets. Making use of data obtained with ground-based and space-based observations we have tested our approach on HD 189733b. Moreover, we have investigated the use of this technique in measuring planetary orbital motion via Doppler shift detection. Finally, we have analyzed synthetic spectra obtained using the SOAP 2.0 tool, which simulates a stellar spectrum and the influence of the presence of a planet or a spot on that spectrum over one orbital period. We have demonstrated that, so long as the signal-to-noise-ratio ≥ 75, our approach reconstructs the planetary orbital period, as well as the rotation period of a spot on the stellar surface.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921602","page":["12"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...12A","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes","Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Agarwal, Sahil","Del Sordo, Fabio","Wettlaufer, John S."],"aff":["Program in Applied Mathematics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA","Department of Astronomy, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA;  Department of Geology & Geophysics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA;  Nordita, Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden","Program in Applied Mathematics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA; Department of Geology & Geophysics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA;  Nordita, Royal Institute of Technology and Stockholm University, SE-10691 Stockholm, Sweden;  Department of Mathematics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA; Department of Physics, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA;  Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/12"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","data":["ESO:1","SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["methods: analytical","methods: data analysis","methods: observational","methods: statistical","planets and satellites: detection","techniques: spectroscopic","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics - Computational Physics","Physics - Space Physics"],"database":["astronomy","physics"],"ack":"\nThe authors thank the referee for comments that have helped to improve our paper, Xavier Dumusque for providing the SOAP 2.0 data used for this work and Debra Fischer and Allen Davis for discussions on this and other detection schemes.

For instance, transient sources such as gamma-ray bursts can be precisely localized without the assistance of secondary focusing X-ray telescopes to enable rapid followup studies. On the other hand, high angular resolution in coded-aperture imaging introduces a new challenge in handling the systematic uncertainty: the average photon count per pixel is often too small to establish a proper background pattern or model the systematic uncertainty in a timescale where the model remains invariant. We introduce two new techniques to improve detection sensitivity, which are designed for, but not limited to, a high-resolution coded-aperture system: a self-background modeling scheme which utilizes continuous scan or dithering operations, and a Poisson-statistics based probabilistic approach to evaluate the significance of source detection without subtraction in handling the background. We illustrate these new imaging analysis techniques in high resolution coded-aperture telescope using the data acquired by the wide-field hard X-ray telescope ProtoEXIST2 during a high-altitude balloon flight in fall 2012. We review the imaging sensitivity of ProtoEXIST2 during the flight, and demonstrate the performance of the new techniques using our balloon flight data in comparison with a simulated ideal Poisson background.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921546","page":["11"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153...11H","bibgroup":["CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Hong, Jaesub","Allen, Branden","Grindlay, Jonathan","Barthelmy, Scott"],"aff":["Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA","NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/11"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","data":["SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["balloons","instrumentation: detectors","techniques: image processing","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis work was supported by NASA/APRA grant NNX14AD59G.\n","doctype":"article","read_count":15,"title":["Imaging Analysis of the Hard X-Ray Telescope ProtoEXIST2 and New Techniques for High-resolution Coded-aperture Telescopes"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T21:01:56.378Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161106275M"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161106275M","2017AJ....153...10M","10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/10","10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/10","1611.06275","2016arXiv161106275M"],"first_author":"Munn, Jeffrey A.","abstract":"A catalog of 8472 white dwarf (WD) candidates is presented, selected using reduced proper motions from the deep proper motion catalog of Munn et al.

Therefore, M-dwarf planetary systems with a known transiting planet are expected to contain additional small planets (r<SUB>p</SUB> ≤ 4 R<SUB>⊕</SUB>, m<SUB>p</SUB> ≲ 20 M<SUB>⊕</SUB>) that are not seen in transit. In this study, we investigate the effort required to detect such planets using precision velocimetry around the sizable subset of M-dwarfs that are slowly rotating (P<SUB>rot</SUB> ≳ 40 days), and hence more likely to be inactive. We focus on the test case of GJ 1132. Specifically, we perform a suite of Monte-Carlo simulations of the star’s radial velocity signal, featuring astrophysical contributions from stellar jitter due to rotationally modulated active regions, as well as Keplerian signals from the known transiting planet and hypothetical additional planets not seen in transit. We then compute the detection completeness of non-transiting planets around GJ 1132 and consequently estimate the number of RV measurements required to detect those planets. We show that, with 1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP> precision per measurement, only ̃50 measurements are required to achieve a 50% detection completeness for all non-transiting planets in the system, as well as planets that are potentially habitable. Throughout this work, we advocate the use of Gaussian process regression as an effective tool for mitigating the effects of stellar jitter including stars with high activity. Given that GJ 1132 is representative of a large population of slowly rotating M-dwarfs, we conclude with a discussion of how our results may be extended to other systems with known transiting planets, such as those that will be discovered with TESS.","read_count":42,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921509","page":["9"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153....9C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Cloutier, Ryan","Doyon, René","Menou, Kristen","Delfosse, Xavier","Dumusque, Xavier","Artigau, Étienne"],"aff":["Dept. of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Toronto. 50 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 3H4, Canada; Centre for Planetary Sciences, Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sciences, University of Toronto Scarborough. 1265 Military Trail, Toronto, Ontario, M1C 1A4, Canada; Institut de recherche sur les exoplanètes, Département de physique, Université de Montréal. 2900 boul. douard-Montpetit, Montréal Quebec, Canada, H3T 1J4","Institut de recherche sur les exoplanètes, Département de physique, Université de Montréal. 2900 boul. douard-Montpetit, Montréal Quebec, Canada, H3T 1J4","Dept. of Astronomy & Astrophysics, University of Toronto. 50 St. George Street, Toronto, Ontario, M5S 3H4, Canada; Centre for Planetary Sciences, Dept. of Physical & Environmental Sciences, University of Toronto Scarborough. 1265 Military Trail, Toronto, Ontario, M1C 1A4, Canada","Université Grenoble Alpes, IPAG, F-38000 Grenoble, France; CNRS, IPAG, F-38000 Grenoble, France","Observatoire Astronomique de l’Université de Genève, 51 Chemin des Maillettes, 1290 Sauverny, Suisse","Institut de recherche sur les exoplanètes, Département de physique, Université de Montréal. 2900 boul. douard-Montpetit, Montréal Quebec, Canada, H3T 1J4"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-5383-9393","-","-","0000-0002-9332-2011","-","0000-0003-3506-5667"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/9"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","data":["NExScI:1","SIMBAD:2"],"keyword":["planets and satellites: detection","planets and satellites: individual: GJ 1132","stars: low-mass","techniques: radial velocities","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nRC would like to thank Jo Bovy, Daniel Fabrycky, and Daniel Tamayo for useful discussions during the preparation of this manuscript, and extend gratitude to the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics for use of the Sunnyvale computing cluster throughout this work.

This paper reports the observation of an arc-like structure to the north of GG Tau Ab, and part of a circumstellar structure that is noticeable around GG Tau Aa, extending to a distance of approximately 28 au from the primary star. The speckle noise around GG Tau Ab constrains its disk radius to < 13 au. Based on the size of the circumbinary ring and the circumstellar disk around GG Tau Aa, the semimajor axis of the binary’s orbit is likely to be 62 au. A comparison of the present observations with previous Atacama Large Millimeter Array and near-infrared H<SUB>2</SUB> emission observations suggests that the north arc could be part of a large streamer flowing from the circumbinary ring to sustain the circumstellar disks. According to the previous studies, the circumstellar disk around GG Tau Aa has enough mass and can sustain itself for a duration sufficient for planet formation; thus, our study indicates that planets can form within close (separation ≲ 100 au) young binary systems.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921593","page":["7"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153....7Y","bibgroup":["NRAO","Subaru","NRAO/Telescopes","ESO/Telescopes","ALMA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Yang, Yi","Hashimoto, Jun","Hayashi, Saeko S.","Tamura, Motohide","Mayama, Satoshi","Rafikov, Roman","Akiyama, Eiji","Carson, Joseph C.","Janson, Markus","Kwon, Jungmi","de Leon, Jerome","Oh, Daehyeon","Takami, Michihiro","Tang, Ya-wen","Kudo, Tomoyuki","Kusakabe, Nobuhiko","Abe, Lyu","Brandner, Wolfgang","Brandt, Timothy D.","Egner, Sebastian","Feldt, Markus","Goto, Miwa","Grady, Carol A.","Guyon, Olivier","Hayano, Yutaka","Hayashi, Masahiko","Henning, Thomas","Hodapp, Klaus W.","Ishii, Miki","Iye, Masanori","Kandori, Ryo","Knapp, Gillian R.","Kuzuhara, Masayuki","Matsuo, Taro","Mcelwain, Michael W.","Miyama, Shoken","Morino, Jun-Ichi","Moro-martin, Amaya","Nishimura, Tetsuo","Pyo, Tae-Soo","Serabyn, Eugene","Suenaga, Takuya","Suto, Hiroshi","Suzuki, Ryuji","Takahashi, Yasuhiro H.","Takato, Naruhisa","Terada, Hiroshi","Thalmann, Christian","Turner, Edwin L.","Watanabe, Makoto","Wisniewski, John","Yamada, Toru","Takami, Hideki","Usuda, Tomonori"],"aff":["Department of Astronomical Science, SOKENDAI (The Graudate University for Advanced Studies), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan; National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan;","Astrobiology Center, NINS, 2-21-1, Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo, 181-8588, Japan","Department of Astronomical Science, SOKENDAI (The Graudate University for Advanced Studies), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan; Subaru Telescope, NAOJ, NINS, 650 North A’ohoku Place, Hilo, HI 96720, USA","National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan; Astrobiology Center, NINS, 2-21-1, Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo, 181-8588, Japan; Department of Astronomy, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan","Department of Astronomical Science, SOKENDAI (The Graudate University for Advanced Studies), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan; National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan","Astrophysics Department, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ 08540, USA","National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan","Department of Physics and Astronomy, College of Charleston, 58 Coming St., Charleston, SC 29424, USA","Department of Astronomy, Stockholm University, AlbaNova University Center, SE-106 91 Stockholm, Sweden","Institute of Space and Astronautical Science, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, 3-1-1 Yoshinodai, Chuo-ku, Sagamihara, Kanagawa 252-5210, Japan","Department of Astronomy, The University of Tokyo, 7-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0033, Japan","Department of Astronomical Science, SOKENDAI (The Graudate University for Advanced Studies), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan; National Astronomical Observatory of Japan (NAOJ), National Institutes of Natural Sciences (NINS), 2-21-1 Osawa, Mitaka, Tokyo 181-8588, Japan; National Meteorological Satellite Center, 64-18, Guam-gil, Gwanghyewon-myeon, Jincheon-gun, Chungbuk, Korea","Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Academia Sinica, P.O.

It is likely the first splitting Encke-type comet ever observed. A nongravitational solution to the astrometry reveals a statistical detection of the radial and transverse nongravitational parameters, {A}<SUB>1</SUB>=(1.54+/- 0.39)× {10}<SUP>-8</SUP> au day<SUP>-2</SUP> and {A}<SUB>2</SUB>=(7.19+/- 1.92)× {10}<SUP>-9</SUP> au day<SUP>-2</SUP>, respectively, which implies a nucleus erosion rate of (9.1+/- 1.7)‰ per orbital revolution. The mass-loss rate likely has to be supported by a much larger fraction of an active surface area than known cases of short-period comets; it may be relevant to the ongoing fragmentation. We failed to detect any serendipitous pre-discovery observations of the comet in archival data from major sky surveys, whereby we infer that 332P used to be largely inactive, and is perhaps among the few short-period comets that have been reactivated from weakly active or dormant states. We therefore constrain an upper limit to the nucleus size as 2.0 ± 0.2 km in radius. A search for small bodies in similar orbits to that of 332P reveals comet P/2010 B2 (WISE) to be the best candidate. From an empirical generalized Jupiter-family (Encke-type included) comet population model, we estimate the likelihood of a chance alignment of the 332P-P/2010 B2 pair to be 1 in 33, a small number indicative of a genetic linkage between the two comets on a statistical basis. The pair possibly originated from a common progenitor, which underwent a disintegration event well before the twentieth century.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14921584","page":["4"],"bibcode":"2017AJ....153....4H","bibgroup":["CFHT"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Hui, Man-To","Ye, Quan-Zhi","Wiegert, Paul"],"aff":["Department of Earth, Planetary and Space Sciences, UCLA, 595 Charles Young Drive East, Los Angeles, CA 90095-1567, USA","Department of Physics and Astronomy, The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, N6A 5B8, Canada","Department of Physics and Astronomy, The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario, N6A 5B8, Canada;  Centre for Planetary Science and Exploration, The University of Western Ontario, London, Ontario N6A 5B8, Canada"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-9067-7477","0000-0002-4838-7676","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"153","doi":["10.3847/1538-3881/153/1/4"],"pub":"The Astronomical Journal","keyword":["comets: general","comets: individual: 332P&Ikeya-Murakami","P&2010 B2 (WISE","methods: data analysis","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThanks are due to the anonymous referee for a prompt review and helpful comments.

A correct assessment of correlated noise is fundamental to determine the true statistical significance of our findings. Here, we review three of the most widely used correlated-noise estimators in the exoplanet field, the time-averaging, residual-permutation, and wavelet-likelihood methods. We argue that the residual-permutation method is unsound in estimating the uncertainty of parameter estimates. We thus recommend to refrain from this method altogether. We characterize the behavior of the time averaging’s rms-versus-bin-size curves at bin sizes similar to the total observation duration, which may lead to underestimated uncertainties. For the wavelet-likelihood method, we note errors in the published equations and provide a list of corrections. We further assess the performance of these techniques by injecting and retrieving eclipse signals into synthetic and real Spitzer light curves, analyzing the results in terms of the relative-accuracy and coverage-fraction statistics. Both the time-averaging and wavelet-likelihood methods significantly improve the estimate of the eclipse depth over a white-noise analysis (a Markov-chain Monte Carlo exploration assuming uncorrelated noise). However, the corrections are not perfect when retrieving the eclipse depth from Spitzer data sets, these methods covered the true (injected) depth within the 68% credible region in only ̃45%-65% of the trials. Lastly, we present our open-source model-fitting tool, Multi-Core Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MC<SUP>3</SUP>). This package uses Bayesian statistics to estimate the best-fitting values and the credible regions for the parameters for a (user-provided) model.

As photons are the messengers, fundamental physics is concerned in testing their properties. Photon mass upper limits have been earlier set through pulsar observations, but new investigations are offered by the excess of dispersion measure (DM), sometimes observed with pulsar and magnetar data at low frequencies, or with the fast radio bursts (FRBs), of yet unknown origin. Arguments for the excess of DM do not reach a consensus, but are not mutually exclusive. Thus, we remind that for massive electromagnetism, dispersion goes as the inverse of the frequency squared. Thereby, new avenues are offered also by the recently operating ground observatories in 10-80 MHz domain and by the proposed Orbiting Low Frequency Antennas for Radio astronomy (OLFAR). The latter acts as a large aperture dish by employing a swarm of nano-satellites observing the sky for the first time in the 0.1-15 MHz spectrum. The swarm must be deployed sufficiently away from the ionosphere to avoid distorsions from terrestrial interference, especially during solar maxima, and offer stable conditions for calibration during observations.","read_count":26,"citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14920571","page":["736"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..736B","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Bentum, Mark J.","Bonetti, Luca","Spallicci, Alessandro D.

In previous work, the Fokker-Planck equation was solved either analytically by using approximations, or by using a numerical approach together with simple models for the pitch-angle scattering coefficient. It is the purpose of the current article so compute particle distribution functions as well as the parallel diffusion coefficient by solving numerically the focused transport equation for a more realistic Fokker-Planck coefficient of pitch-angle scattering. Our analytical form for the scattering parameter is based on non-linear diffusion theory that takes into account realistic scattering at pitch-angles close to 90 ° . This general form contains the isotropic form as well as the quasi-linear limit as special cases. We show that the ratio of the diffusion coefficients with and without focusing sensitively depends on the ratio of the turbulent magnetic field and the mean field. The assumed form of the pitch-angle Fokker-Planck coefficient has an influence on the parallel diffusion coefficient. In all considered cases we found a reduction of the ratio of the diffusion coefficients if the ratio of magnetic fields is reduced.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","id":"14920575","bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..722L","aff":["Department of Physics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Department of Physics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada","Department of Physics, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, MB R3T 2N2, Canada"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"issue":"2","pub":"Advances in Space Research","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementsJ.

Although all three textures types can be observed at all latitudes, plume-like dust storms tend to dominate the northern mid-latitudes, pebbled dust storms tend to dominate the southern mid-latitudes, and puffy dust storms tend to dominate the low latitudes.

When dealing with hundreds of thousands of space objects such as in the space conjunction assessment, the memory required for the tabulated orbits or the computing time for propagating orbits using the state vector are both confronting to users. This paper presents two methods of analytically representing numerical orbits considering the accuracy, computing efficiency and memory. The first one is a two-step TLE-based method in which the numerical orbits are first fitted into a TLE set and then correction functions are applied to improve the position accuracy. In the second method, the orbit states are represented in equinoctial elements first, and then again correction functions are applied to reduce the position errors. Experiments using six satellite laser ranging (SLR) satellites and 12 debris objects with accurate orbits show that both methods can represent the accurate orbits over 5 days in an accuracy of a few dozens of meters for the circular orbits and several hundred meters for the eccentric orbits. The computing time is similar to that using the NORAD TLE/SGP4 algorithm, and storage for the orbit elements and function coefficients is about 3-5 KB. These features could make the two methods beneficial for the maintenance of orbit catalog of large numbers of space objects.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920576","page":["698"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..698S","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..698S","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.031","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.031"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Sang, Jizhang","Li, Bin","Chen, Junyu","Zhang, Pin","Ning, Jinsheng"],"aff":["School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, 129 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, China","School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, 129 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, China","School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, 129 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, China","School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, 129 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, China","School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, 129 Luoyu Road, Wuhan, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.031"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Space objects","Precise orbit prediction","Orbit representation","Catalogue management"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementThis work is sponsored by National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 41474024).

The long-term dynamical evolution of this type of special orbit is investigated in this paper. First, the effect of Earth's gravitational potential is examined. A simplified Hamiltonian of Tundra-type orbits subjected to Earth's gravitational potential is presented through a strict magnitude comparison of the involved terms. Based on this simplified Hamiltonian with two degrees of freedom, the equilibrium points of the orbits subjected to Earth's gravitational potential and their stabilities are discussed. This simplified Hamiltonian is then reduced to a one-degree-of-freedom system dominating the intermediate-period motion of the orbits approximately. In particular, the main characteristic parameters of the intermediate-period motion for nominal Tundra-type orbits and the corresponding specific results for three Sirius satellites in such orbits are presented. Second, the effect of lunisolar perturbations is examined. A magnitude comparison elementarily illustrates that the effect of tesseral harmonics of the Earth's gravitational potential on the long timespan evolution of Tundra-type orbits is negligible compared to that of lunisolar perturbations. A simplified dynamical model including lunisolar perturbations is then presented. Based on this simplified dynamical model, the influences of lunar precession, the initial longitude of the ascending node, the initial argument of perigee, and the initial epoch on the long-term dynamical evolution of the orbits are comparatively analyzed. Finally, numerical calculations with exact perturbation models are conducted to verify the theoretical analysis and to provide more information about the dynamical evolution of Tundra-type orbits.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","id":"14920524","bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..682Z","aff":["Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","School of Commerce, Jinan University, Jinan 250022, China","Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China","Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing 210008, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"2","pub":"Advances in Space Research","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementThis work is supported by the Key Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11533010) and the Youth Program of the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 11603078).

In this contribution, analysis of the classical TCAR models and limiting factors is given. It is concluded that the residual double-differencing (DD) ionospheric delay is the key limitation to the medium and long range narrow-lane (NL) ambiguity resolution in step 3 of the classical TCAR method. To improve this algorithm, the third step of the classical TCAR method is modified accordingly. The modified TCAR comprises three major steps. Step 1 and step 2 are the same as the classical TCAR, which is the geometry-free determination of the extra-wide-lane (EWL) and wide-lane (WL) ambiguities. Then we can derive the DD first-order ionospheric delay estimated from the ambiguity-fixed EWL. As the noise term of the estimated DD ionospheric delay is very large, the smooth method is employed to correct the estimated DD ionospheric delay. In step 3, the smooth DD ionospheric delay is used to completely correct the single-epoch DD float NL ambiguity resolution. It is also noted that there exist cycle-slips which influence the process of the ionosphere-smooth method. This is followed by a procedure to repair the cycle-slip. As a result, the modified-TCAR method shows a much better performance than the classical TCAR method over medium and long baseline.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920486","page":["670"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..670T","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..670T","10.1016/j.asr.2016.04.010","10.1016/j.asr.2016.04.010"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V.

A space tethered towing method is explored that utilizes thrust to fulfill transfer and bounded tension to stabilize tether heading. For this purpose, a time-energy optimal orbit is designed by Gauss pseudospectral method. The theoretical attitude commands are obtained by equilibria analysis. An effective attitude control strategy is presented where the commands are optimized first and then feedback controller is designed. To deal with the underactuated problem with tension constraint, hierarchical sliding mode theory is employed and an adaptive anti-windup module is added to mitigate the actuator saturation. Simulation results show that the target is towed effectively by the thrusts, and a smooth tracking for the commands of tether length and in-plane tether heading is guaranteed by the bounded tension. In addition, the designed controller also presents appreciable robustness to model error and determination error.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920459","page":["656"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..656M","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..656M","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.014","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.014"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Meng, Zhongjie","Wang, Bingheng","Huang, Panfeng"],"aff":["-","-","-"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.014"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Space tether","Tethered towing method","Underactuated control","Actuator saturation","Anti-windup"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsThis research is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 61005062 and 11272256), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant No: 3102014JCQ01005) and Seed Foundation of Innovation and Creation for Graduate Students in Northwestern Polytechnical University (Grant No: Z2016050).","doctype":"article","title":["A space tethered towing method using tension and platform thrusts"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-10T19:21:18.160Z"},{"read_count":0,"first_author":"Dell'Agnello, S.","abstract":"During Summer 2015 the SCF_Lab (Satellite/lunar/GNSS laser ranging/altimetry and cube/microsat Characterization Facilities Laboratory, http://www.lnf.infn.it/esperimenti/etrusco, Team of INFN-LNF, with support by ASI, carried out an intense activity of final design, manufacturing and testing in order to construct, space qualify and finally integrate INRRI-EDM/2016 on ESA's ExoMars EDM spacecraft (also dubbed \"Schiaparelli\"), which was successfully launched on March 14, 2016. INRRI (INstrument for landing-Roving laser Retroreflector Investigation) for the EDM (Entry descent and landing Demonstration Module) 2016 mission is a compact, lightweight, passive, maintenance-free array of eight cube corner laser retroreflectors fixed to an aluminum alloy frame through the use of silicon rubber suitable for space applications. INRRI was installed on the top panel of the EDM Central Bay on October 14, 2015. It will enable the EDM to be laser-located from Mars orbiters, through laser ranging and altimetry, lidar atmospheric observations from orbit, laser flashes emitted by orbiters, and lasercom. One or all of the above means of observation can be supported by INRRI when there is an active, laser-equipped orbiter, especially after EDM end-of-life and for a long time. INRRI goals will cover science (Mars geodesy/geophysics, future Mars test of General Relativity, GR), technology and exploration. Concerning the latter two, INRRI will support mars-georeferencing of the EDM landing site, support potential precision lidar-based landing next to the EDM, support test & diagnostics of lasercom for data exchange among Mars orbit, Mars surface and Earth, and it will be a precursor for additional Mars surface retroreflectors, for example on exploration rovers. This paper describes in detail our innovative payload, hopefully the very first to be deployed safely with the lander Schiaparelli on the Mars surface, and its space qualification for the ExoMars EDM 2016 mission. Despite the fate of the Schiaparelli landing, which is still under the investigation of ESA and the industry, this paper remains a valuable reference for next INRRI-like laser retroreflectors arrays.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920497","page":["645"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..645D","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..645D","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.011","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.011"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Dell'Agnello, S.","Delle Monache, G.","Porcelli, L.","Boni, A.","Contessa, S.","Ciocci, E.","Martini, M.","Tibuzzi, M.","Intaglietta, N.","Salvatori, L.","Tuscano, P.","Patrizi, G.","Mondaini, C.","Lops, C.","Vittori, R.","Maiello, M.","Flamini, E.","Marchetti, E.","Bianco, G.","Mugnuolo, R.","Cantone, C."],"aff":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare - Laboratori Nazionali di Frascati (INFN-LNF), Via E.

Our results show that the ionospheric storm has prominent latitudinal dependence, with negative storm prevailing at high latitudes and positive storm at lower latitudes. The maximum ratio of positive to negative storms is observed at around 30°N magnetic latitude. The ionospheric response depends also on the phases of the storm. The occurrence of positive storm decreases during recovery phase when compared to that during main phase, while the negative storm presents opposite pattern. However, the occurrence of positive storm increases at equatorial and low latitudes during recovery phase. Additionally, during main phase, the occurrence of negative storm is higher at equatorial and low latitudes than that at middle latitudes. The local time dependences of the ionospheric storm onsets are quite different for different latitudes. The negative storm mainly occurs from post-middle night to morning hours and the positive storm mainly occurs during daytime at middle latitudes; while both the positive and negative storms mainly occur during nighttime at equatorial latitude. For all latitudes, the typical time delay between the main phase onset and the onset time of ionospheric negative storm is longer than 10 h, while it is shorter than 10 h for positive storm (expect at low and equatorial latitudes). We further check the longitudinal dependence of the ionospheric storm at middle latitude, and find that the occurrence of positive storm is higher in American and Asian sectors than that in European sector, and the non-significant storm is mostly observed in European sector. The 'forbidden time interval' of negative storm in Asian sector is different with that in American and European sectors.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920565","page":["603"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..603L","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..603L","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.032","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.032"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Liu, Wenjing","Xu, Liang","Xiong, Chao","Xu, Jisheng"],"aff":["School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China","School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China","GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences, Telegrafenberg, 14473 Potsdam, Germany","School of Electronic Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430072, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.032"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Ionospheric storms","TEC","Latitude and longitude dependences"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentThe study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant nos. 40974087, 41431073 and 41274160).

Yu.","abstract":"A numerical model is used to study systematically the evolution of large scale irregularities depending on the IMF Bz and By components, solar zenith angle (seasonal and daily variation), solar and geomagnetic activity. The model enables to reproduce the 3-D distribution of electron density over the high-latitude F region ionosphere in the altitude range between 130 and 640 km. Since the convection electric field driven by changes in solar wind conditions has an important effect on the high-latitude ionosphere, the rotation of the IMF vector in the Y-Z plane causes a significant redistribution of the ionospheric plasma. Under the southward IMF conditions the plasma density is enhanced over a large portion of the near-pole ionosphere as a tongue of ionization, while the northward IMF leads to a considerable depletion and occurrence of the polar hole. The IMF By polarity is crucial for the shift and extension of the tongue of ionization to the dusk or dawn side. Particle precipitation also plays a role through a localized increase of the electron density mostly within the auroral oval and more pronounced auroral peak. The solar zenith angle, especially its seasonal variation, is the strongest regular factor influencing the electron density magnitude and spatial distribution. In winter, when the polar ionosphere is in darkness, large variations associated with different solar wind condition are more prominent. The daily variation of the zenith angle considerably modifies the Ne within a particular pattern. At a given time, the combined action of the IMF, solar zenith angle, level of solar and geomagnetic activity produces a complicated ionospheric response which can be considered as a superposition of different effects. Quantitative estimates of the ionospheric response to each factor are presented.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920691","page":["557"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..557L","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..557L","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.010","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.010"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Lukianova, R.

Equivalent current vectors are plotted for each geomagnetic quiet day (Ap ⩽ 5), using diurnal variations of H and D components measured at the magnetic observatories located in a narrow longitudinal belt of the Indo-Russian region. On the formation of well-defined Sq current loop, the information about the Sq focus is extracted by identifying a pair of neighboring stations with opposite zonal currents and nearby local times with opposite meridional currents. Thus, the method employed here is different from the methods used in earlier studies. Prominent seasonal variations in the Sq focus latitude, as well as in the local time of Sq focus, are observed. It is observed that the Sq focus is located at ∼30 deg in March equinox, but it moves to lower latitudes in the month of September. In winter, it shows large variability and also the formation of clear Sq current loop is less frequent. The local time of Sq focus is at ∼12 LT in March and shifts to ∼10 LT during September. It is clearly evident from the present analysis that the March and September equinoxes behave differently. The dominance of DE3 and semidiurnal waves in the September equinox could be the reason for the observed disparity.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920681","page":["542"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..542V","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..542V","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.009","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.009"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Vichare, Geeta","Rawat, Rahul","Jadhav, Madhavi","Sinha, Ashwini Kumar"],"aff":["Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, New Panvel, Navi Mumbai, India; >Earlier known as Geeta Jadhav","Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, New Panvel, Navi Mumbai, India; >Earlier known as Geeta Jadhav","Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, New Panvel, Navi Mumbai, India; >Earlier known as Geeta Jadhav","Indian Institute of Geomagnetism, New Panvel, Navi Mumbai, India; >Earlier known as Geeta Jadhav"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.009"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Sq focus latitude","Seasonal variation of Sq focus","Local time of Sq focus"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementGeomagnetic data (hourly) from Indian sector is available on request by contacting Director, Indian Institute of Geomagnetism (email: director@iigs.iigm.res.in).

A sudden depletion in TEC variations appeared ∼6 min after the rocket launch. The drops in slant TEC exceeded 17 TEC unit (TECU) and those in vertical TEC were approximately 7 TECU. It is remarkable that the TEC drop by the 2016 Kwangmyongsong-4 rocket is larger (almost by three times) than that by the 2012 Unha-3 rocket. There are the differences of the background TEC values at the 2012 and the 2016 cases. These results suggest that the difference of the background electron density affects the magnitude of TEC depletion. The horizonal velocity of the rocket was 1.6 km/s, which was estimated from horizontal distances with an initial time of TEC disturbances. However, the 2012 Unha-3 rocket (∼2.5 km/s) moved faster horizontally than the 2016 Kwangmyongsong-4 rocket. Furthermore, when the rocket moved from high latitudes to low latitudes, TEC disturbances reduced gradually, and then, the depletion persisted for a longer time at the west side (the right side of southern direction).","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14920637","page":["532"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..532C","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..532C","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.012","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.012"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Choi, Byung-Kyu","Kil, Hyosub"],"aff":["Space Science Division, Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute, Daejeon 305-348, South Korea","Space Department, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, Laurel, MD 20723, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"issue":"2","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.012"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Ionosphere","Rocket launch","Total electron content","Neutral winds"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsThis study was supported by the 2016 Primary Project of the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute (Project: Operation of Space Geodetic Infra-facilities and Research on Astronomical Almanac).","doctype":"article","title":["Large ionospheric TEC depletion induced by the 2016 North Korea rocket"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-04T15:31:08.074Z"},{"read_count":0,"first_author":"Lei, Yu","abstract":"UT1-UTC predictions especially short-term predictions are essential in various fields linked to reference systems such as space navigation and precise orbit determinations of artificial Earth satellites. In this paper, an integrated model combining the grey model GM(1, 1) and neural networks (NN) are proposed for predicting UT1-UTC. In this approach, the effects of the Solid Earth tides and ocean tides together with leap seconds are first removed from observed UT1-UTC data to derive UT1R-TAI. Next the derived UT1R-TAI time-series are de-trended using the GM(1, 1) and then residuals are obtained. Then the residuals are used to train a network. The subsequently predicted residuals are added to the GM(1, 1) to obtain the UT1R-TAI predictions. Finally, the predicted UT1R-TAI are corrected for the tides together with leap seconds to obtain UT1-UTC predictions. The daily values of UT1-UTC between January 7, 2010 and August 6, 2016 from the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS) 08 C04 series are used for modeling and validation of the proposed model. The results of the predictions up to 30 days in the future are analyzed and compared with those by the GM(1, 1)-only model and combination of the least-squares (LS) extrapolation of the harmonic model including the linear part, annual and semi-annual oscillations and NN.

In addition, the predictions are compared with those from the Earth Orientation Parameters Prediction Comparison Campaign (EOP PCC) lasting from October 1, 2005 to February 28, 2008.

In this study, in order to overcome shortcomings of traditional observation methods in meteorology, a new method is proposed to calculate global mean surface temperature based on remote sensing data. We found that (1) the global mean surface temperature was close to 14.35 °C from 2001 to 2012, and the warmest and coldest surface temperatures of the global in the recent twelve years occurred in 2005 and 2008, respectively; (2) the warmest and coldest surface temperatures on the global land surface occurred in 2005 and 2001, respectively, and on the global ocean surface in 2010 and 2008, respectively; and (3) in recent twelve years, although most regions (especially the Southern Hemisphere) are warming, global warming is yet controversial because it is cooling in the central and eastern regions of Pacific Ocean, northern regions of the Atlantic Ocean, northern regions of China, Mongolia, southern regions of Russia, western regions of Canada and America, the eastern and northern regions of Australia, and the southern tip of Africa. The analysis of daily and seasonal temperature change indicates that the temperature change is mainly caused by the variation of orbit of celestial body. A big data model based on orbit position and gravitational-magmatic change of celestial body with the solar or the galactic system should be built and taken into account for climate and ecosystems change at a large spatial-temporal scale.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14920633","page":["503"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..503M","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..503M","10.1016/j.asr.2016.11.007","10.1016/j.asr.2016.11.007"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Mao, K.

Like lunar surface, dust particles are also exposed to plasmas and UV radiation and, consequently they carry electrostatic charges. During Solar Energetic Particle events (SEPs) secondary electron emission plays a vital role in charging of lunar dusts. To study the lunar dust charging during SEPs on lunar wake region, we derived an expression for lunar dust potential and analysed how it varies with different electron temperatures and grain radii. Because of high energetic solar fluxes, secondary yield (δ) values reach up to 2.3 for 0.5 μm dust grain. We got maximum yield at an energy of 550 eV which is in well agreement with lunar sample experimental observation (Anderegg et al., 1972). It is observed that yield value increases with electron energy, reaches to a maximum value and then decreases. During SEPs heavier dust grains show larger yield values because of the geometry of the grains. On the wake region, the dust potential reaches up to -497 V for 0.5 μm dust grain. The electric field of these grains could present a significant threat to manned and unmanned missions to the Moon.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920642","page":["483"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..483C","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..483C","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.027","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.027"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Chandran, S.

The dielectric constant of alumina is extracted from these measurements using the Bruggeman (Effective Medium Approximation) mixing equation. We develop a model to account for heterogeneity within the airline, specifically in regards to local variation in porosity. The results of the model show good correlation to experimental data and effectively correct for grain size effects on the measured bulk permittivity. We show that particle shape can have a significant impact on the output of the model and can be accounted for by modelling particles as ellipsoids rather than perfect spheres, where the depolarization factor must be measured and averaged for a specific sample batch.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920641","page":["472"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..472H","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..472H","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.011","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.011"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Hickson, Dylan","Sotodeh, Shahroukh","Daly, Michael G.","Ghent, Rebecca","Nolan, Michael C."],"aff":["Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science, York University, Toronto, Canada","Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science, York University, Toronto, Canada","Centre for Research in Earth and Space Science, York University, Toronto, Canada","Solar System Exploration Group, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Planetary Science Institute, Tucson, USA","Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, University of Arizona, Tucson, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.011"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Asteroid regolith","OSIRIS-REx","Radar","Permittivity","Alumina","Dielectric"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementsThis work was funded in part by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC).","doctype":"article","title":["Improvements on effective permittivity measurements of powdered alumina: Implications for bulk permittivity properties of asteroid regoliths"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-05T19:06:32.555Z"},{"read_count":0,"first_author":"Lou, Taishan","abstract":"An innovative integrated navigation scheme based on MCAV/Radio measurement information during Mars powered descent phase, and a robust desensitized central difference Kalman filter (DCDKF) for systems with uncertain parameters or biases are proposed to improve the navigation descent accuracy.

Before employing such technology for a dedicated science mission, it is desirable, if not necessary, to demonstrate its reliability with a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of six or higher. The aim of the work presented here is to provide reliable technology that enables the controlled deployment and verification of its functionality with various laboratory tests, thereby qualifying the hardware for a first demonstration in low Earth orbit (LEO). The development was made in the Gossamer-1 project of the German Aerospace Center (DLR). This paper provides an overview of the Gossamer-1 mission and hardware development. The system is designed based on the requirements of a technology demonstration mission. The design rests on a crossed boom configuration with triangular sail segments. Employing engineering models, all aspects of the deployment were tested under ambient environment. Several components were also subjected to environmental qualification testing. An innovative stowing and deployment strategy for a controlled deployment, as well as the designs of the bus system, mechanisms and electronics are described. The tests conducted provide insights into the deployment process and allow a mechanical characterization of that deployment process, in particular the measurement of the deployment forces. Deployment on system level could be successfully demonstrated to be robust and controllable. The deployment technology is on TRL four approaching level five, with a qualification model for environmental testing currently being built.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920657","page":["434"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..434S","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..434S","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.022","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.022"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Seefeldt, Patric","Spietz, Peter","Sproewitz, Tom","Grundmann, Jan Thimo","Hillebrandt, Martin","Hobbie, Catherin","Ruffer, Michael","Straubel, Marco","Tóth, Norbert","Zander, Martin"],"aff":["German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Space Systems, Robert-Hooke-Str. 7, 28359 Bremen, Germany","German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Space Systems, Robert-Hooke-Str. 7, 28359 Bremen, Germany","German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Space Systems, Robert-Hooke-Str. 7, 28359 Bremen, Germany","German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Space Systems, Robert-Hooke-Str. 7, 28359 Bremen, Germany","German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems - Composite Design, Lilienthalplatz 7, 38108 Braunschweig, Germany","German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Space Systems, Robert-Hooke-Str. 7, 28359 Bremen, Germany","Julius-Maximilians-University Wuerzburg, Computer Science 8 - Aerospace Information Technology, Germany","German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems - Composite Design, Lilienthalplatz 7, 38108 Braunschweig, Germany","German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Space Systems, Robert-Hooke-Str. 7, 28359 Bremen, Germany","German Aerospace Center (DLR) - Institute of Composite Structures and Adaptive Systems - Composite Design, Lilienthalplatz 7, 38108 Braunschweig, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.022"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Gossamer-1","Gossamer structures","Deployable structures","Solar sailing","Controlled deployment"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsThis work was funded by DLR German Aerospaces Research and Development program for technology of space systems as Gossamer-1 Deployment Technology Demonstrator Project.

First, the physical property of passivity of Euler-Lagrange system is exploited to design the position and attitude controllers by taking a simpler obstacle-free control problem into account. To reduce sensing and actuating requirements, the vibration modes of the beam appendage are supposed to be not directly measured and actuated on. Besides, the requirements of measuring velocities are removed with the aid of a dynamic extension technique. Second, the bounding boxes in the form of super-quadric surfaces are exploited to enclose the maximal extents of the obstacles and the hub-beam spacecraft. The collision avoidance between bounding boxes is achieved by applying additional repulsive force and torque to the spacecraft based on the method of artificial potential field.

The principal idea of this method is simplifying the nonlinear squared distance function into a Taylor series with limited orders and further fitting the trigonometric functions in the derivative function of the simplified squared distance by piece-wise quadratic polynomials. By solving the zero-crossing points of the fitted quadratic curve, the critical points of the original nonlinear distance function are approximately determined. It turns out that the accuracy of the obtained solutions of the extreme distances depends on the number of intervals of the polynomial fitting. The bigger the number of intervals is, the better the accuracy. However, it is also noticed that the number of intervals is not necessary too big. For real applications a small value (e.g. 8) may be enough for the number of intervals. Besides, the method is apparently more effective for the small eccentricity cases.

This paper shows the results of the validation of electromagnetic and hadronic processes with the aim to contribute to the study of protection for astronauts against the radiations due to the Solar Particle Events, in particular to the selection of the optimal material for radiation shielding. The physics case deals with the interaction of a proton beam with an aluminum slab about 20 g/cm<SUP>2</SUP> thick. Two specific applications, STP and DOSE, were developed by using Geant4 package. STP computes the radiations produced in the interaction and their stopping power; DOSE computes the absorbed dose from the stopping power calculated by STP. The validation process was performed in two steps. In the first one, the output of the STP code is compared to data available on NIST database; in the second one, the absorbed dose computed with DOSE is compared to the dose gathered during an experiment performed at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory involving the bombardment of an aluminum slab with a 1 GeV proton beam. The computing model has allowed us to correlate the size of the impinging beam profile to the dose measured before and after an Al slab. The sharp increase of the dose in the position right after the slab might be due to the stochastic nature of the trajectories of charged ions in matter which makes the radiation to emerge with non-zero transverse linear momentum. From the case examined here, we conclude that aluminum is not an efficient material for Solar Particle Event shielding.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920679","page":["393"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..393L","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..393L","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.028","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.028"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Loffredo, Filomena","Vardaci, Emanuele","Quarto, Maria","Roca, Vincenzo","Pugliese, Mariagabriella"],"aff":["Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) Sez.

The ARs are characterized by McIntosh classification. Statistical analysis demonstrates that SEP events are more likely to be associated to the ARs having complex magnetic structures and the most energetic SEPs are ejected only from the associated ARs having a large and asymmetric penumbra. This tendency is used to estimate intensities of potential SEP events. For this purpose we express a probability of occurrence of an SEP event from a given AR which is correlated with fluxes of associated SEPs. We find that SEP events associated with ARs from eastern longitudes have to be more complex to produce SEP events at Earth. On the other hand, SEP particles originating from mid-longitudes (30 ° < longitude < 70 °) on the west side of solar disk are associated to the least complex ARs.

In this work, the relation between the solar activity and cosmic ray variations and the cardiac arrhythmias over the time period 1997-2009 covering the solar cycle 23, is studied. The used medical data set refers to 4741 patients with cardiac arrhythmias and 2548 of whom were diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, obtained from the 2nd Cardiological Clinic of the General Hospital of Nicaea, Piraeus, in Greece. The smoothing method on a 365-day basis and the Pearson r-coefficient were used in order to compare these records with the number of sunspots, flares, solar proton events, coronal mass ejections and cosmic ray intensity. Applying a moving correlation function to ±1500 days, it is suggested that a change of the correlation sign between the medical data and each one of the above parameters occurs during a time interval of about 2-3 years. This interval corresponds to the time span of the polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field of this solar cycle, which always takes place around the solar cycle maximum. After then a correlation analysis was carried out corresponding to the rise (1997-2001) and the decay (2002-2009) phases of the solar cycle 23. It is noticeable that the polarity reversal of the solar magnetic field coincides with the period where the sign of the correlation between the incidence of arrhythmias and the occurrence number of the solar eruptive events and the cosmic ray intensity, changes sign. The results are comparable with those obtained from the previous solar cycle 22 based on medical data from another country.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920628","page":["366"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..366M","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..366M","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.024","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.024"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Mavromichalaki, H.","Preka-Papadema, P.","Theodoropoulou, A.","Paouris, E.","Apostolou, Th."],"aff":["Nuclear and Particle Physics Department, Faculty of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 15784 Athens, Greece","Astrophysics, Astronomy and Mechanics Department, Faculty of Physics, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 15784 Athens, Greece","Environment and Health.

In this respect, this paper attempts an investigation of the long-term behavior of the ionospheric disturbances from the solar minimum between the solar cycles 23 and 24 up to the solar maximum of solar cycle 24. The analysis is based on observations of the foF2 critical frequency and the hmF2 peak electron density height obtained in the European region, records of the Dst and AE indices, as well as measurements of energetic particle fluxes from NOAA/POES satellites fleet. The discussion of the ionospheric behavior in a wide range of geophysical conditions within the same solar cycle facilitates the determination of general trends in the ionospheric response to different faces of space weather driving. According to the evidence, the disturbances in the peak electron density reflect mainly the impact of geoeffective solar wind structures on the Earth's ionosphere. The intensity of the disturbances may be significant (greater than 20% with respect to normal conditions) in all cases, but the ionospheric response tends to have different characteristics between solar minimum and solar maximum conditions. In particular, in contrast to the situation in solar maximum, in solar minimum years the solar wind impact on the Earth's ionosphere is mainly built on the occurrence of ionization increases, which appear more frequent and intense than ionization depletions. The ionization enhancements are apparent in all local time sectors, but they peak in the afternoon hours, while a significant part of them seems not related with an F2 layer uplifting. Taking into account the main interplanetary drivers of the disturbances in each case, i.e. high speed streams (HSSs) and corotating interaction regions (CIRs) in solar minimum and coronal mass ejections (CME) in solar maximum, we argue that the identified tendency may be considered as evidence of the ionospheric response to different solar wind drivers.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920674","page":["351"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..351T","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..351T","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.004","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.004"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Tsagouri, Ioanna","Galkin, Ivan","Asikainen, Timo"],"aff":["National Observatory of Athens, Greece","Center for Atmospheric Research, University of Massachusetts Lowell, Lowell, MA, USA","University of Oulou, Finland"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.004"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Ionosphere","Ionospheric disturbances","Space weather","Ionospheric predictions"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementsThe Dst and the AE indices are provided by the World Data Center for Geomagnetism, Kyoto (http://wdc.kugi.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dstdir/).

The potential of Narrowband SEE (NSEE) as a new diagnostic tool to monitor artificial irregularities excited during HF-pump heating of the ionosphere is the main goal of this paper. This has been investigated using well established diagnostics including the Modular UHF Ionospheric Radar (MUIR) and Kodiak SuperDARN radars as well as Wideband SEE (WSEE). The measured data using these three diagnostics were compared to characterize the ionospheric parameters and study the plasma irregularities generated in the interaction region. Variation of the wideband/narrowband SEE features, SuperDARN echoes, and HF-enhanced ion lines (EHIL) were studied with pump power variation, pump frequency stepping near the third electron gyro-frequency (3f<SUB>ce</SUB>) as well as changing beam angle relative to the magnetic zenith. In particular, electrostatic plasma waves and associated irregularities excited near the reflection resonance layer as well as the upper-hybrid resonance layer are investigated. The time evolution and growth rate of these irregularities are studied using the experimental observations. Close alignment of narrowband SEE (NSEE) with wideband SEE (WSEE) and EHIL was observed. SuperDARN radar echoes and WSEE also showed alignment as in previous investigations. Correlations between these three measurements underscore potential diagnostics by utilizing the NSEE spectrum to estimate ionospheric parameters such as electron temperature.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920685","page":["337"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..337M","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..337M","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.029","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.029"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Mahmoudian, A.","Scales, W.

M.","abstract":"Inverse Abel transform is the most common method to invert radio occultation (RO) data in the ionosphere and it is based on the assumption of the spherical symmetry for the electron density distribution in the vicinity of an occultation event. It is understood that this 'spherical symmetry hypothesis' could fail, above all, in the presence of strong horizontal electron density gradients. As a consequence, in some cases wrong electron density profiles could be obtained. In this work, in order to incorporate the knowledge of horizontal gradients, we have suggested an inversion technique based on the adaption of the empirical ionospheric model, NeQuick2, to RO-derived TEC. The method relies on the minimization of a cost function involving experimental and model-derived TEC data to determine NeQuick2 input parameters (effective local ionization parameters) at specific locations and times. These parameters are then used to obtain the electron density profile along the tangent point (TP) positions associated with the relevant RO event using NeQuick2. The main focus of our research has been laid on the mitigation of spherical symmetry effects from RO data inversion without using external data such as data from global ionospheric maps (GIM). By using RO data from Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate (FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC) mission and manually scaled peak density data from a network of ionosondes along Asian and American longitudinal sectors, we have obtained a global improvement of 5% with 7% in Asian longitudinal sector (considering the data used in this work), in the retrieval of peak electron density (NmF2) with model-assisted inversion as compared to the Abel inversion. Mean errors of NmF2 in Asian longitudinal sector are calculated to be much higher compared to American sector.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920622","page":["326"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..326S","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..326S","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.006","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.006"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Shaikh, M.

In this work, some characteristic parameters of the equatorial electrojet were estimated on the basis of the IPS-42 ionosonde data at Korhogo during the years 1993 and 1994. The study consisted of determining the zonal electric field through an estimate of the plasma vertical drift velocity. The daytime plasma vertical drift velocity was estimated from the time rates of change of the F-layer virtual height variations and a correction term that takes into account the ionization production and recombination effects. This method resulted in an improved vertical drift velocity, which was found to be comparable to the results of previous studies. The estimated vertical drift velocity was used in a semi-empirical approach which involved the IRI-2012 model for the Pedersen and Hall conductivities and the IGRF-10 model for the geomagnetic main field intensity. Thus the zonal and polarization electric fields on one hand, and the eastward Pedersen, Hall and the equatorial electrojet current densities on the other hand, were estimated. Furthermore the integrated peak current density at the EEJ center was estimated from ionosonde observations and compared with that inferred from magnetometer data. The integrated EEJ peak current densities obtained from both experiments were found to be in the same order and their seasonal variations exhibit the same trends as well.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920588","page":["311"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..311G","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..311G","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.004","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.004"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Grodji, F.

Inside the magnetosphere, the results of computer simulations demonstrated that nonlinear wave-particle interaction can also result in the gyrophase bunching of particles. However, to date direct observations barely exist regarding this issue occurred inside the magnetosphere. In this paper, we report for the first time an event of gyrophase bunched ions observed in the near-Earth plasma sheet. The nongyrotropic distributions of ions were closely accompanied with the electromagnetic waves at the oxygen cyclotron frequency. The phase of bunched ions and the phase of waves mainly have very narrow phase differences (<30°) when the O<SUP>+</SUP> band waves are remarkably enhanced, which indicates that the wave and particle are closely corotating. The \"electric phase bunching\" is considered to be a possible mechanism for the formation of the gyrophase bunched distributions in this case. The MVA analysis suggests that the oxygen band waves possess left helicity with respect to the propagation direction, which agrees with the characteristic of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. The observation of O<SUP>+</SUP> ions composition suggests that the oxygen band waves are excited due to the enhancements of the O<SUP>+</SUP> ion density. This study suggests that the gyrophase bunching is a significant nonlinear effect that exists not only in the bow shock but also in the inner magnetosphere.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920602","page":["274"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..274W","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..274W","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.003","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.003"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Wang, Zhiqiang","Zhai, Hao","Gao, Zhuxiu","Huang, Chaoyan"],"aff":["Department of Space Science and Application, College of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","Department of Space Science and Application, College of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China","China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology, Beijing, China","Department of Space Science and Application, College of Astronautics, Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Nanjing, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.003"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Gyrophase bunching","Oxygen band waves","Wave-particle interaction"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsWe thank for the data provided by all the instrument teams of Cluster mission.

This, in turn, generates a control scheme to make all states move toward to the desired states. The stability analysis of the proposed control law indicates not only all states converge to the desired states at equilibrium but also disturbances caused by the uncertainty can be suppressed satisfactorily. Parametric studies are conducted to investigate the influences of fractional order and sub-sliding manifold of unactuated states on the performance of the proposed control law. The performance is compared with the sliding mode, PD and fractional order PD control laws for a baseline scenario of tether deployment. The proposed control law performs better than others in the settling time and the maximum pitch angle control in the presence of unwanted disturbances.

In particular, the estimation of pose, motion and inertia properties of an uncooperative object is a challenging task because of the lack of available a priori information. This paper develops a novel method to estimate the relative position, velocity, angular velocity, attitude and the ratios of the components of the inertia matrix of an uncooperative space object using only stereo-vision measurements. The classical Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) are used and compared for the estimation procedure. In addition, in order to compute the inertia properties, the ratios of the inertia components are added to the state and a pseudo-measurement equation is considered in the observation model. The relative simplicity of the proposed algorithm could be suitable for an online implementation for real applications. The developed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations in MATLAB using different initial conditions and uncertainty levels. The goal of the simulations is to verify the accuracy and robustness of the proposed estimation algorithm. The obtained results show satisfactory convergence of estimation errors for all the considered quantities. The obtained results, in several simulations, shows some improvements with respect to similar works, which deal with the same problem, present in literature. In addition, a video processing procedure is presented to reconstruct the geometrical properties of a body using cameras. This inertia reconstruction algorithm has been experimentally validated at the ADAMUS (ADvanced Autonomous MUltiple Spacecraft) Lab at the University of Florida. In the future, this different method could be integrated to the inertia ratios estimator to have a complete tool for mass properties recognition.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920673","page":["236"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..236P","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..236P","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.002","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.002"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier Science B.V.

This filter does not cause code tracking bias in the case of an ideal analog receiver channel when its magnitude and phase response are constant; however, distortion is induced by RF cables, amplifiers, and mixers that results in an asymmetric correlation function. This correlation function is further deformed by the adaptive transversal filter, resulting in a nonzero bias. Given the adaptive nature of this transversal filter, the bias varies based on the jamming pattern. For precision navigation applications, this bias must be mitigated. With this problem in mind, a new technique called amplitude estimating delay lock loop (AEDLL) is presented. By using data related to a known structure of the adaptive transversal filter, the proposed method only needs to estimate the amplitude of the correlation function and revise the correlation function for code tracking. Simulations show that the AEDLL method is capable of reducing the RMSE of code tracking bias to less than 0.12 ns, which is significantly smaller than that achieved using existing methods.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920623","page":["230"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..230F","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..230F","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.007","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.007"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Fan, Guangteng","Huang, Yangbo","Su, Yingxue","Li, Jingyuan","Sun, Guangfu"],"aff":["National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Satellite Navigation R&D Center, DeYa Road, Changsha 410073, China","National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Satellite Navigation R&D Center, DeYa Road, Changsha 410073, China","National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Satellite Navigation R&D Center, DeYa Road, Changsha 410073, China","National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Satellite Navigation R&D Center, DeYa Road, Changsha 410073, China","National University of Defense Technology, School of Electronic Science and Engineering, Satellite Navigation R&D Center, DeYa Road, Changsha 410073, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.007"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["GNSS receiver","Non-ideal channel","Anti-jamming","Code tracking bias","Adaptive transversal filter","Precision navigation"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["A reduced bias delay lock loop for adaptive filters"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-04T11:15:10.095Z"},{"read_count":3,"first_author":"Bédard, Donald","abstract":"Time-resolved spectrometric measurements of the Galaxy 11 geostationary satellite were collected on three consecutive nights in July 2014 with the 1.6-m telescope at the Observatoire du Mont-Mégantic in Québec, Canada.

Originally these efforts concentrated mainly on the geostationary region (GEO). Corresponding observation strategies, processing techniques and cataloguing approaches have been developed and successfully applied. The ESA GEO surveys, e.g., resulted in the detection of a significant population of small-size debris and later in the discovery of high area-to-mass ratio objects in GEO-like orbits. Comparably less experience (both, in terms of practical observation and strategy definition) is available for eccentric orbits that (at least partly) are in the MEO region, in particular for the Molniya-type orbits. Different survey and follow-up strategies for searching space debris objects in highly-eccentric MEO orbits, and to acquire orbits which are sufficiently accurate to catalog such objects and to maintain their orbits over longer time spans were developed. Simulations were performed to compare the performance of different survey and cataloguing strategies. Eventually, optical observations were conducted in the framework of an ESA study using ESA's Space Debris Telescope (ESASDT) the 1-m Zeiss telescope located at the Optical Ground Station (OGS) at the Teide Observatory at Tenerife, Spain. Thirteen nights of surveys of Molniya-type orbits were performed between January and August 2013. Eventually 255 surveys were performed during these thirteen nights corresponding to about 47 h of observations. In total 30 uncorrelated faint objects were discovered. On average one uncorrelated object was found every 100 min of observations.

These simulations usually rely on the propagation of a large population of objects in order to determine the collision probability for each object. Explosion and collision events are triggered randomly using a Monte-Carlo (MC) approach. So in many different scenarios different objects are fragmented and contribute to a different version of the space debris environment. The results of the single Monte-Carlo runs therefore represent the whole spectrum of possible evolutions of the space debris environment. For the comparison of different scenarios, in general the average of all MC runs together with its standard deviation is used. This method is computationally very expensive due to the propagation of thousands of objects over long timeframes and the application of the MC method. At the Institute of Space Systems (IRAS) a model capable of describing the evolution of the space debris environment has been developed and implemented. The model is based on source and sink mechanisms, where yearly launches as well as collisions and explosions are considered as sources. The natural decay and post mission disposal measures are the only sink mechanisms. This method reduces the computational costs tremendously. In order to achieve this benefit a few simplifications have been applied. The approach of the model partitions the Low Earth Orbit (LEO) region into altitude shells. Only two kinds of objects are considered, intact bodies and fragments, which are also divided into diameter bins. As an extension to a previously presented model the eccentricity has additionally been taken into account with 67 eccentricity bins. While a set of differential equations has been implemented in a generic manner, the Euler method was chosen to integrate the equations for a given time span. For this paper parameters have been derived so that the model is able to reflect the results of the numerical MC-based simulation Long-term Utility for Collision Analysis (LUCA), which is also being developed at the IRAS.

For the last 5-10 years, few studies have demonstrated the possibility to also observe smaller water bodies than previously thought feasible (river smaller than 500 m wide and lake below 10 km<SUP>2</SUP>). The present study aims at quantifying the nadir altimetry performance over a medium river (200 m or lower wide) with a pluvio-nival regime in a temperate climate (the Garonne River, France). Three altimetry missions have been considered: ENVISAT (from 2002 to 2010), Jason-2 (from 2008 to 2014) and SARAL (from 2013 to 2014). Compared to nearby in situ gages, ENVISAT and Jason-2 observations over the lower Garonne River mainstream (110 km upstream of the estuary) have the smallest errors, with water elevation anomalies root mean square errors (RMSE) around 50 cm and 20 cm, respectively. The few ENVISAT upstream measurements have RMSE ranging from 80 cm to 160 cm. Over the estuary, ENVISAT and SARAL water elevation anomalies RMSE are around 30 cm and 10 cm, respectively. The most recent altimetry mission, SARAL, does not provide river elevation measurements for most satellite overflights of the river mainstream. The altimeter remains \"locked\" on the top of surrounding hilly areas and does not observe the steep-sided river valley, which could be 50-100 m lower. This phenomenon is also observed, for fewer dates, on Jason-2 and ENVISAT measurements. In these cases, the measurement is not \"erroneous\", it just does not correspond to water elevation of the river that is covered by the satellite. ENVISAT is less prone to get 'locked' on the top of the topography due to some differences in the instrument measurement parameters, trading lower accuracy for more useful measurements. Such problems are specific to continental surfaces (or near the coasts), but are not observed over the open oceans, which are flatter. To overcome this issue, an experimental instrument operating mode, called the DIODE/DEM tracking mode, has been developed by CNES (Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales) and has been tested during few Jason-2 cycles and during the first SARAL/AltiKA cycle. This tracking mode \"forces\" the instrument to observe a target of interest, i.e. water bodies. The example of the Garonne River shows, for one SARAL ground track, the benefit of the DIODE/DEM tracking mode for a steep-sided river reach, which is not detected using the nominal instrument operating mode. Yet, this mode relies on ancillary datasets (a priori global DEM and global land/water mask), which are critical to obtain river valley observation. The ultimately computed elevations along the satellite tracks, loaded on board, should have an absolute vertical accuracy around 10 m (or better). This case also shows, when the instrument is correctly observing the river valley, that the altimeter can detect water bodies narrower than 100 m (like an artificial canal). In agreement with recent studies, this work shows that altimeter missions can provide useful water elevation measurements over a 200 m wide river with RMSE as low as 50 cm and 20 cm, for ENVISAT and Jason-2 respectively. The seasonal cycle can be observed with the temporal sampling of these missions (35 days and 10 days, respectively), but short term events, like flood events, are most of the time not observed. It also illustrates that altimeter capability to observe a river is highly dependent of the surrounding topography, the observation configuration, previous measurements and the instrument design. Therefore, it is not possible to generalize at global scale the minimum river width that could be seen by altimeters. This study analyzes, for the first time, the potential of the experimental DIODE/DEM tracking mode to observe steep-sided narrow river valleys, which are frequently missed with nominal tracking mode. For such case, using the DIODE/DEM mode could provide water elevation measurements, as long as the on board DEM is accurate enough. This mode should provide many more valid measurements over steep-sided rivers than currently observed.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920618","page":["128"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..128B","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..128B","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.008","10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.008"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Biancamaria, S.","Frappart, F.","Leleu, A. -S.","Marieu, V.","Blumstein, D.","Desjonquères, Jean-Damien","Boy, F.","Sottolichio, A.","Valle-Levinson, A."],"aff":["LEGOS, Université de Toulouse, CNES, CNRS, IRD, UPS - 14 avenue Edouard Belin, 31400 Toulouse, France","LEGOS, Université de Toulouse, CNES, CNRS, IRD, UPS - 14 avenue Edouard Belin, 31400 Toulouse, France","LEGOS, Université de Toulouse, CNES, CNRS, IRD, UPS - 14 avenue Edouard Belin, 31400 Toulouse, France","EPOC, Université de Bordeaux, CNRS - Bâtiment B18, allée Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, CS 50023, 33615 Pessac Cedex, France","LEGOS, Université de Toulouse, CNES, CNRS, IRD, UPS - 14 avenue Edouard Belin, 31400 Toulouse, France","CNES - 18 avenue Edouard Belin, 31401 Toulouse Cedex, France","CNES - 18 avenue Edouard Belin, 31401 Toulouse Cedex, France","EPOC, Université de Bordeaux, CNRS - Bâtiment B18, allée Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, CS 50023, 33615 Pessac Cedex, France","University of Florida, Civil and Coastal Engineering Department, Gainesville, FL 32611, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.10.008"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Satellite altimetry","Garonne River","DIODE/DEM mode","ENVISAT","Jason-2","SARAL"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementsThis project was funded by the Rseau Thmatique de Recherche Avance - Sciences et Technologies pour lAronautique et lEspace (RTRA-STAE, Toulouse, France), through a grant attributed to the Ressources en Eau sur le bassin de la GARonne: interaction entre les composantes naturelles et anthropiques et apport de la tlDtection (REGARD) project.IGN, SCHAPI (especially Etienne Le Pape), DREAL Midi-Pyrnes (especially Didier Narbas-Jaureguy), SHOM and Grand Port Maritime de Bordeaux (especially Alain Fort) are gratefully thanked for providing freely all the DEM, in situ data and ancillary information used in this study.CTOH observation service at LEGOS (http://ctoh.legos.obs-mip.fr/) is also acknowledged for processing and providing altimetry data in a uniform format for all missions.CNES, ESA, ISRO and NASA are acknowledged for providing freely to the scientific community measurements from the ENVISAT/RA2, Jason-2/Poseidon-3 and SARAL/AltiKa altimeters.Three anonymous reviewers are thanked for their constructive comments that helped to improve this paper.","doctype":"article","title":["Satellite radar altimetry water elevations performance over a 200 m wide river: Evaluation over the Garonne River"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-12T19:00:50.045Z"},{"read_count":0,"first_author":"Pitoňák, Martin","abstract":"In this article we discuss a regional recovery of gravity disturbances at the mean geocentric sphere approximating the Earth over the area of Central Europe from satellite gravitational gradients. For this purpose, we derive integral formulas which allow converting the gravity disturbances onto the disturbing gravitational gradients in the local north-oriented frame (LNOF). The derived formulas are free of singularities in case of r ≠ R . We then investigate three numerical approaches for solving their inverses. In the initial approach, the integral formulas are firstly modified for solving individually the near- and distant-zone contributions. While the effect of the near-zone gravitational gradients is solved as an inverse problem, the effect of the distant-zone gravitational gradients is computed by numerical integration from the global gravitational model (GGM) TIM-r4. In the second approach, we further elaborate the first scenario by reducing measured gravitational gradients for gravitational effects of topographic masses. In the third approach, we apply additional modification by reducing gravitational gradients for the reference GGM. In all approaches we determine the gravity disturbances from each of the four accurately measured gravitational gradients separately as well as from their combination. Our regional gravitational field solutions are based on the GOCE EGG_TRF_2 gravitational gradients collected within the period from November 1 2009 until January 11 2010. Obtained results are compared with EGM2008, DIR-r1, TIM-r1 and SPW-r1. The best fit, in terms of RMS (2.9 mGal), is achieved for EGM2008 while using the third approach which combine all four well-measured gravitational gradients. This is explained by the fact that a-priori information about the Earth's gravitational field up to the degree and order 180 was used.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920585","page":["114"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..114P","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..114P","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.024","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.024"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Pitoňák, Martin","Šprlák, Michal","Novák, Pavel","Tenzer, Robert"],"aff":["NTIS - New Technologies for the Information Society, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, Technická 8, 306 14 Plzeň, Czech Republic","NTIS - New Technologies for the Information Society, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, Technická 8, 306 14 Plzeň, Czech Republic","NTIS - New Technologies for the Information Society, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, Technická 8, 306 14 Plzeň, Czech Republic","NTIS - New Technologies for the Information Society, Faculty of Applied Sciences, University of West Bohemia, Technická 8, 306 14 Plzeň, Czech Republic; The Key Laboratory of Geospace Environment and Geodesy, School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Chinese Ministry of Education, Wuhan University, 129 Luoyu Road, Wuhan 430079, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.024"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Hotine's integral","Gravity disturbances","Downward continuation","Regional gravitational field modelling","Satellite gravitational gradients"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementAuthors acknowledge the Czech Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport for the financial support by the National Program of Sustainability, Project No. LO1506.Thoughtful and constructive comments of two anonymous reviewers and Mehdi Eshagh are gratefully acknowledged.

In this paper, the coseismic ionospheric disturbances were analyzed using Vertical Total Electron Content from Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) observations obtained from 309 continuous tracking stations around the epicenter. The results show that significant ionospheric disturbances occurred within 10 min after the earthquake. The maximum anomaly reached 1.34 TECU; the maximum duration was 10 min; the farthest anomaly was found beyond 3000 km from the epicenter. The ionospheric response was attributed to two modes: shock acoustic waves and Rayleigh wave. Within 500 km from the epicenter, ionosphere anomaly was induced by both waves, with average propagating speed of 0.61 and 1.62 km/s, respectively. With increasing epicentral distance, the ionospheric disturbances caused by acoustic waves gradually weakened, whereas Rayleigh waves induced ionosphere disturbances reached up to 3000 km from the epicenter. The propagation speed of Rayleigh waves gradually increased to 2.74 km/s while the distance from the epicenter to sub-ionospheric point was over 1500 km. The occurrence of the disturbances appeared strong directivity. The amplitudes of the disturbances were large to the south of the epicenter. In contrast, to the northwest of the epicenter, few disturbances were observed, and the amplitudes of these disturbances were small. In general, the amplitude of the anomaly decreased with increasing epicentral distance. However, the amplitude of the anomaly increased at 1500-2500 km to the northeast of the epicenter.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920665","page":["103"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59..103C","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59..103C","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.021","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.021"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Chen, Peng","Yao, Yibin","Yao, Wanqiang"],"aff":["College of Geomatics, Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an 710054, China","School of Geodesy and Geomatics, Wuhan University, Wuhan 430079, China","College of Geomatics, Xi'an University of Science and Technology, Xi'an 710054, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.021"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["GPS","Total electron content","Coseismic ionospheric disturbances"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementsThanks to IGS and CMONOC to provide the GPS data.

Results of these techniques show obvious seasonal vertical deformation with high consistency at almost all stations. The GPS-derived seasonal vertical deformation can be explained, to some content, by the environmental mass redistribution effect represented by GRACE and SLMs. Though the mean weighted root mean square reduction is 34% after removing the environmental mass loading from the monthly GPS height time series (up to 47% for the mean annual signals), systematic signals are still evident in the residual time series. The systematic residuals are probably attributed to GPS related errors, such as draconitic errors, while the leakage errors in the GRACE data processing and unmodeled components in land water storage should be considered in some regions. Additionally, the obvious seasonal residual perturbations in Southwest China may be related to the leakage errors in the GRACE data processing and large uncertainty in the land water storage in SLMs, indicating that GPS observations may provide more realistic mass transport estimates in Southwest China.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920668","page":["88"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59...88G","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59...88G","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.008","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.008"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Gu, Yanchao","Yuan, Linguo","Fan, Dongming","You, Wei","Su, Yong"],"aff":["Faculty of Geoscience and Environment Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China; State-province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Spatial Information Technology of High-speed Rail Safety, Chengdu 611756, China","Faculty of Geoscience and Environment Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China; State-province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Spatial Information Technology of High-speed Rail Safety, Chengdu 611756, China","Faculty of Geoscience and Environment Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China; State-province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Spatial Information Technology of High-speed Rail Safety, Chengdu 611756, China","Faculty of Geoscience and Environment Engineering, Southwest Jiaotong University, Chengdu 611756, China; State-province Joint Engineering Laboratory of Spatial Information Technology of High-speed Rail Safety, Chengdu 611756, China","School of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Southwest Petroleum University, Chengdu 610500, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.008"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["GPS","GRACE","Surface loading models","Crustal vertical deformation","Environmental mass loading"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementsWe thank Jeff Freymueller and other two anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments, and Editor-in-Chief Pascal Willis for his constructive suggestions.

This paper aims to establish a thermal characteristic index (TCI) to explore rock thermal behavior responding to defined environmental systems. The study area is located in the northern Qinghai Province, China, on the northern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, where mafic-ultramafic rock, quartz-rich rock, alkali granite rock and carbonate rock are well exposed; the pixel samples of these rocks and vegetation were obtained based on relevant indices and geological maps. The scatter plots of TCI indicate that mafic-ultramafic rock and quartz-rich rock can be well extracted from other surface objects when interference from vegetation is lower. On account of the complexity of environmental systems, three periods of TCI were used to construct a three-dimensional scatter plot, named the multi-temporal thermal feature space (MTTFS) model. Then, the Bayes discriminant analysis algorithm was applied to the MTTFS model to extract rocks quantitatively. The classification accuracy of mafic-ultramafic rock is more than 75% in both training data and test data, which suggests TCI can act as a sensitive indicator to distinguish rocks and the MTTFS model can accurately extract mafic-ultramafic rock from other surface objects. We deduce that the use of thermodynamics is promising in lithology identification when an effective index is constructed and an appropriated model is selected.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920609","page":["74"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59...74W","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59...74W","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.005","10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.005"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Wei, Jiali","Liu, Xiangnan","Ding, Chao","Liu, Meiling","Jin, Ming","Li, Dongdong"],"aff":["School of Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, China","School of Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, China","School of Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, China","School of Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, China","School of Information Engineering, China University of Geosciences, 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, China","School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences, 29 Xueyuan Road, Beijing 100083, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.09.005"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Lithology identification","Thermal characteristic index","Multi-temporal thermal feature space model"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsThis work was supported by the project Survey and Evaluation of Geology and Mineral Resources of the Metallogenic belt at the peripheral and adjacent area of Qaidam Basin, Qinghai province of the China Geological Survey (project ID: 1212011121188).

Over recent years how to study the indirect climate effect of aerosols has become an important research topic. In this study we attempted to understand the complex mutual interactions among aerosols, clouds and precipitation through analysis of the spatial correlation between aerosol optical depth (AOD), cloud effective radius (CER) and precipitation during 2000-2012 in central-eastern China that has one of the highest concentrations of aerosols globally. With the assistance of moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)-derived aerosol and cloud product data, this analysis focuses on regional differentiation and seasonal variation of the correlation in which in situ observed precipitation was incorporated. On the basis of the achieved results, we proposed four patterns depicting the mutual interactions between aerosols, clouds and precipitation. They characterize the indirect effects of aerosols on the regional scale. These effects can be summarized as complex seasonal variations and north-south regional differentiation over the study area. The relationship between AOD and CER is predominated mostly by the first indirect effect (the negative correlation between AOD and CER) in the north of the study area in the winter and spring seasons, and over the entire study area in the summer season. The relationship between CER and precipitation is dominated chiefly by the second indirect effect (the positive correlation between CER and precipitation) in the northern area in summer and over the entire study area in autumn. It must be noted that aerosols are not the factor affecting clouds and rainfall singularly. It is the joint effect of aerosols with other factors such as atmospheric dynamics that governs the variation in clouds and rainfall.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920676","page":["63"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59...63C","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59...63C","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.042","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.042"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Cheng, Feng","Zhang, Jiahua","He, Junliang","Zha, Yong","Li, Qiannan","Li, Yunmei"],"aff":["Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Key Laboratory of Virtual Geographic Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Geographic Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210097, China","Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100094, China","Department of Resources and Environment, Shijiazhuang University, Shijiazhuang 050035, China","Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Key Laboratory of Virtual Geographic Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Geographic Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210097, China","Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Key Laboratory of Virtual Geographic Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Geographic Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210097, China","Jiangsu Center for Collaborative Innovation in Geographical Information Resource Development and Application, Key Laboratory of Virtual Geographic Environment of Ministry of Education, College of Geographic Science, Nanjing Normal University, Nanjing 210097, China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.042"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Aerosol indirect effect","Aerosol optical depth","Cloud effective radius","Precipitation"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsThis research was funded by the National 973 Project (no. 2014CB953802), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 41671428, 41671340, 41471282), the 135 Key Planning Cultivation Direction Project of Institute of Remote Sensing and Digital Earth (no.

According to the mission profile, the required formation is typically maintained and/or controlled by executing maneuvers. In order to generate consistent and precise orbit products, a strategy for maneuver handling is mandatory in order to avoid discontinuities or precision degradation before, after and during maneuver execution. Precise orbit determination offers the possibility of maneuver estimation in an adjustment of single-satellite trajectories using GPS measurements. However, a consistent formulation of a precise relative orbit determination scheme requires the implementation of a maneuver estimation strategy which can be used, in addition, to improve the precision of maneuver estimates by drawing upon the use of differential GPS measurements. The present study introduces a method for precise relative orbit determination based on a reduced-dynamic batch processing of differential GPS pseudorange and carrier phase measurements, which includes maneuver estimation as part of the relative orbit adjustment. The proposed method has been validated using flight data from space missions with different rates of maneuvering activity, including the GRACE, TanDEM-X and PRISMA missions. The results show the feasibility of obtaining precise relative orbits without degradation in the vicinity of maneuvers as well as improved maneuver estimates that can be used for better maneuver planning in flight dynamics operations.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920653","page":["45"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59...45A","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59...45A","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.039","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.039"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Allende-Alba, Gerardo","Montenbruck, Oliver","Ardaens, Jean-Sébastien","Wermuth, Martin","Hugentobler, Urs"],"aff":["Institute for Astronomical and Physical Geodesy, Technische Universität München, Arcisstraße 21, 80333 München, Germany; Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), German Space Operations Center, Münchner Straße 20, 82234 Weßling, Germany","Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), German Space Operations Center, Münchner Straße 20, 82234 Weßling, Germany","Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), German Space Operations Center, Münchner Straße 20, 82234 Weßling, Germany","Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR), German Space Operations Center, Münchner Straße 20, 82234 Weßling, Germany","Institute for Astronomical and Physical Geodesy, Technische Universität München, Arcisstraße 21, 80333 München, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.039"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["Precise relative orbit determination","Maneuver estimation","GPS","GRACE","TanDEM-X","PRISMA"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgmentsThe present study makes use of data that have been made available by the JPLs Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PODAAC), the GeoForschungsZentrum (GFZ) Postdam, the European Space Agency (ESA/ESTEC) Noordwijk, the Center for Orbit Determination in Europe (CODE) and the International GNSS Service (IGS).

The in situ data-based nitrate algorithm was used to generate nitrate images by using the satellite-derived chlorophyll and SST images. To link ocean productivity with the sea surface features and sea level anomaly, the Indo-French altimeter mission SARAL-ALTIKA-derived sea surface height anomaly (SSHa) data sets were processed and maps were generated. The monthly average chlorophyll concentration ranged from 0.001 to 3.0 mg m<SUP>-3</SUP>, SST ranged from 24 to 32 °C, nitrate concentration ranged from 0.01 to 6.0 μM, and overall SSH anomaly ranged from -52 to +40 cm. Nitrate concentration was observed to be high (3-5 μM) during December-January, possibly due to convective eddies and winter cooling as well as atmospheric aerosols and dust inducing ocean productivity. The nitrate concentration was observed to be associated more with chlorophyll than SST, as nitrate inherently enhances the ocean chlorophyll and productivity, acting as proxy. The SSH anomaly showed irregular features and depicting few eddies, upwelling, and ocean circulation features. The low SSHa was mostly due to high chlorophyll concentration. It was observed that the low SST (∼24-26 °C) is attributed to high chlorophyll concentration (1.5-3.0 mg m<SUP>-3</SUP>) over the study area. The lag phase and enhancement in chlorophyll mean during September was due to the decrease in average SST during August. The SSHa showed seasonal trend over the study area during the monsoon period with observation of negative anomaly. Arabian Sea was found to have more negative SSH anomaly monthly mean values than Bay of Bengal. The impact and interrelationship of SSHa indicated better relationship with chlorophyll than with nitrate and SST, as observed from multiple regression analysis. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) results between the 2-year monthly data showed that the interannual variability is lowest for SST, followed by chlorophyll (p = 0.002), SSHa (p = 0.053), and nitrate (p = 0.068).","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920663","page":["33"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59...33S","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59...33S","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.038","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.038"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Sarangi, R.

Then we studied how to retrieve the ground tilting information of the station point with the collocated GPS and strong-motion observations, the information is an important input parameter of rotational seismology. In addition, both experimental result and seismic data show that the baseline shift error is mainly caused by the ground tiling and rotation during the co-seismic period.

This study presents methodology and quality assessment of selected methods allowing for multi-GNSS observations combining in relative kinematic positioning using baselines up to tens of kilometers. In specific, this paper characterizes loose and tight integration strategies applied to the ionosphere and troposphere weighted model. Performance assessment of the established strategies was based on the analyses of the integer ambiguity resolution and rover coordinates' repeatability obtained in the medium range instantaneous RTK positioning with the use of full constellation dual frequency GPS and Galileo signals. Since full constellation of Galileo satellites is not yet available, the observational data were obtained from a hardware GNSS signal simulator using regular geodetic GNSS receivers. The results indicate on similar and high performance of the loose, and tight integration with calibrated receiver ISBs strategies. These approaches have undeniable advantage over single system positioning in terms of reliability of the integer ambiguity resolution as well as rover coordinate repeatability.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920660","page":["12"],"bibcode":"2017AdSpR..59...12P","identifier":["2017AdSpR..59...12P","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.034","10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.034"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 COSPAR","author":["Paziewski, Jacek","Wielgosz, Pawel"],"aff":["University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland","University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"issue":"1","volume":"59","doi":["10.1016/j.asr.2016.08.034"],"pub":"Advances in Space Research","keyword":["GNSS","Precise relative positioning","Galileo","GPS","Inter system bias","RTK"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"AcknowledgementsThe author would like to gratefully acknowledge Dr. Jaron Samson for an opportunity to use GNSS signals simulator at ESTEC/ESA laboratory.This study was supported by the statutory research grant of the Faculty of Geodesy, Geospatial and Civil Engineering/UWM in Olsztyn.","doctype":"article","title":["Investigation of some selected strategies for multi-GNSS instantaneous RTK positioning"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-04T17:40:30.285Z"},{"read_count":0,"first_author":"Padalia, Hitendra","abstract":"India launched C band (5.35 GHz) RISAT-1 (Radar Imaging Satellite-1) on 26th April, 2012, equipped with the capability to image the Earth at multiple-resolutions and -polarizations.

Atmospheric neutrinos are a background for these challenging measurements, but their rate is expected to be negligible above $\\approx$ 1 PeV. In this work we describe the feasibility to study ultra-high energy neutrinos based on the Earth-skimming technique, by detecting the charged leptons produced in neutrino-nucleon interactions in a high mass target. We propose to detect the charged leptons, or their decay products, with the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) observatory, and use as a large mass target for the neutrino interactions the Pico de Orizaba volcano, the highest mountain in Mexico. In this work we develop an estimate of the detection rate using a geometrical model to calculate the effective area of the observatory.

The analysis is from the point of view of an observer, with much of the emphasis placed on how observations, and the modelling of observations, have constrained what we known about GRB-SNe. We discuss their photometric and spectroscopic properties, their role as cosmological probes, including their measured luminosity$-$decline relationships, and how they can be used to measure the Hubble constant. We present a statistical analysis of their bolometric properties, and use this to determine the properties of the \"average\" GRB-SNe: which has a kinetic energy of $E_{\\rm K} \\approx 2.5\\times10^{52}$ erg, an ejecta mass of $M_{\\rm ej} \\approx 6$ M$_{\\odot}$, a nickel mass of $M_{\\rm Ni} \\approx 0.4$ M$_{\\odot}$, a peak photospheric velocity of $v_{\\rm ph} \\approx 21,000$ km s$^{-1}$, a peak bolometric luminosity of $L_{\\rm p} \\approx 1\\times10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, and it reaches peak bolometric light in $t_{\\rm p} \\approx 13$ days. We discuss their geometry, consider the various physical processes that are thought to power the luminosity of GRB-SNe, and whether differences exist between GRB-SNe and the SNe associated with ultra-long duration GRBs. We discuss how observations of the environments of GRB-SNe further constrain the physical properties of their progenitor stars, and give an overview of the current theoretical paradigms of their suspected central engines. We also present an overview of the radioactively powered transients that have been photometrically associated with short-duration GRBs. We conclude the review by discussing what additional research is needed to further our understanding of GRB-SNe, in particular the role of binary-formation channels and the connection of GRB-SNe with superluminous SNe (abridged).","read_count":119,"citation_count":33,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14920694","page":["8929054"],"bibcode":"2017AdAst2017E...5C","pubdate":"2017-00-00","author":["Cano, Zach","Wang, Shan-Qin","Dai, Zi-Gao","Wu, Xue-Feng"],"aff":["-","-","-","-"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-9509-3825","-","-","0000-0002-6299-1263"],"volume":"2017","doi":["10.1155/2017/8929054"],"pub":"Advances in Astronomy","keyword":["Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["The Observer's Guide to the Gamma-Ray Burst Supernova Connection"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-12T19:04:20.540Z"},{"read_count":0,"first_author":"Zhenqi, He","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920672","page":["4162838"],"bibcode":"2017AdAst2017E...4Z","identifier":["2017AdAst2017E...4Z","10.1155/2017/4162838","10.1155/2017/4162838"],"pubdate":"2017-00-00","author":["Zhenqi, He","Ke, Zhang","Meibai, Lv"],"aff":["-","-","-"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0002-1989-8063","-","-"],"volume":"2017","doi":["10.1155/2017/4162838"],"pub":"Advances in Astronomy","database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["Research on Control Method of Keeping Flight Formation by Using SDRE on the Sun-Earth Libration Points"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-03T18:15:49.618Z"},{"read_count":0,"first_author":"Blazek, Martin","citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920638","page":["316289"],"bibcode":"2017AdAst2017E...3B","identifier":["2017AdAst2017E...3B","10.1155/2017/3162892","10.1155/2017/3162892"],"pubdate":"2017-00-00","author":["Blazek, Martin","Pata, Petr","Inneman, Adolf","Skala, Petr"],"aff":["-","-","-","-"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0003-0034-7891","-","-","-"],"volume":"2017","doi":["10.1155/2017/3162892"],"pub":"Advances in Astronomy","database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["Astronomical Tasks for Tests of X-Ray Optics in VZLUSAT-1 Nanosatellite"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-03T18:15:49.618Z"},{"read_count":7,"first_author":"Zhelyazkov, Ivan","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920650","page":["262649"],"bibcode":"2017AdAst2017E...2Z","identifier":["2017AdAst2017E...2Z","10.1155/2017/2626495","10.1155/2017/2626495"],"pubdate":"2017-00-00","author":["Zhelyazkov, Ivan","Chandra, Ramesh","Srivastava, Abhishek K."],"aff":["-","-","-"],"orcid_pub":["0000-0001-6320-7517","-","-"],"volume":"2017","doi":["10.1155/2017/2626495"],"pub":"Advances in Astronomy","database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["Modeling Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability in Soft X-Ray Solar Jets"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-09T19:12:55.973Z"},{"arxiv_class":["General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv160101460S"],"identifier":["2016arXiv160101460S","2017AdAst2017E...1S","10.1155/2017/6127031","1601.01460","2016arXiv160101460S","10.1155/2017/6127031"],"first_author":"Suh, In-Saeng","abstract":"The spatially conformally flat approximation (CFA) is a viable method to deduce initial conditions for the subsequent evolution of binary neutron stars employing the full Einstein equations.

The experimental data indicate that for all systems substantial energy dissipation takes place, in the first stage of the reaction, although the number of transferred nucleons is small. On the other hand, in the second stage, a large number of nucleons are transferred with small friction and small consumption of time. To understand the observed behavior, various reactions were analyzed based on the microscopic time-dependent Hartree-Fock (TDHF) theory. From a systematic analysis for $^{40,48}$Ca+$^{124}$Sn, $^{40}$Ca+$^{208}$Pb, $^{40}$Ar+$^{208}$Pb, $^{58}$Ni+$^{208}$Pb, $^{64}$Ni+$^{238}$U, $^{136}$Xe+ $^{198}$Pt, and $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U reactions, we find that TDHF reproduces well the measured trends. In addition, the Balian-V\\'en\\'eroni variational principle is applied to head-on collisions of $^{238}$U+$^{238}$U, and the variance of the fragment masses is compared with the experimental data, showing significant improvement.

It is commonly believed that the smaller timescale corresponds to the more inner region. The low-hard state and hard intermediate state are especially highlighted. Data analysed results are discussed in the framework of Lense-Thirring precession. Results are in favor of the perturbation propagation regime for explaining the observed time lags. Although the timing analysis in the frequency range of band limited noise and red noise is carried out, and a possibly existing break point is found, the model to explain them is still not established. More work is needed to understand the innermost accretion region.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920231","page":["7"],"bibcode":"2017AcASn..58....7X","identifier":["2017AcASn..58....7X"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Xiao, G.

Compared with the short-term prediction of a few days, the priority concerns are the calculation speed, as well as the accuracies of major orbital elements including the semi-major axis and the eccentricity which define the shape of the orbit, the orbital inclination and the right ascension of the ascending node which define the orientation of the orbit. Given such requirements, it is preferable to adopt the semi-analytical method, which averages the system over the orbital period, and integrates the averaged system using the numerical method. However, throughout available literatures, it is rarely seen that the semi-analytical methods are quantitatively assessed regarding the accuracy when applied to various types of orbits. In this paper, we would like to report our implementation and assessment of the semi-analytical method, expecting that it would help us estimate its feasibility in the long-term orbital prediction. The quantitative assessment covers the commonly used orbits for the Earth satellites. In some rare special cases where the performance of our method appears abnormal, we discuss the reasons and possible solutions. We hope our results can provide some useful references for the similar application of the semi-analytical method since our method is a relatively common approach in terms of both accuracy and implementation.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14920307","page":["3"],"bibcode":"2017AcASn..58....3W","identifier":["2017AcASn..58....3W"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Wang, D.

The delta Scuti star beta Pic (NSV 16683) (3.80-3.86V) is one of the BRITE stars being focused on during this season. Bet Pic is particularly interesting now because a transit of the star's planet's Hill sphere (the region around a planet in which it dominates the attraction of satellites) is predicted to occur during 2017-2018. Ongoing observations beginning now are valuable to establish a baseline prior to the transit. The AAVSO's webpage on the BRITE target stars was updated in November with information on bet Pic from Dr. Zwintz. AAVSO observers with appropriate equipment and located at a southern enough latitude are encouraged to observe bet Pic. Its brightness makes bet Pic well suited to PEP and DSLR photometry; CCD photometry is also possible. However, great care must be taken by all observers, especially those using CCD, to avoid saturation. As the amplitude of this star is very small, visual observations are very difficult, but they are welcome. Multicolor (BVR) photometry better than 0.01 magnitude and time-series observations with a cadence of a few minutes (less than 10 minutes) are requested beginning now and continuing at least through 2017 and likely through 2018. The precision and cadence required are essential in order for the data to be most useful for studying the transit. Spectroscopists wishing to participate should submit their spectra directly to Dr. Konstanze Zwintz (konstanze.zwintz@uibk.ac.at).

This approach allows the removal of the dispersive effects of the interstellar medium and enables searches for pulsed emission from pulsars and other millisecond-duration transients at low observing frequencies and/or high DMs where time broadening of the signal due to dispersive smearing would otherwise severely reduce the sensitivity. The implementation, called cdmt, for coherent dispersion measure trials, exploits the parallel processing capability of general-purpose graphics processing units to accelerate the computations. We describe the coherent dedispersion algorithm and detail how cdmt implements the algorithm to efficiently compute many coherent DM trials. We apply the concept of a semi-coherent dedispersion search, where coherently dedispersed trials at coarsely separated DMs are subsequently incoherently dedispersed at finer steps in DM. The software is used in an ongoing LOFAR pilot survey to test the feasibility of performing semi-coherent dedispersion searches for millisecond pulsars at 135 MHz. This pilot survey has led to the discovery of a radio millisecond pulsar-the first at these low frequencies. This is the first time that such a broad and comprehensive search in DM-space has been done using coherent dedispersion, and we argue that future low-frequency pulsar searches using this approach are both scientifically compelling and feasible. Finally, we compare the performance of cdmt with other available alternatives.","read_count":52,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14919850","page":["40"],"bibcode":"2017A&C....18...40B","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Bassa, C.

Our aim is to use sparse survey datasets to estimate the full shape of the redshift distribution that is defined by the degeneracies in galaxy photometric properties and redshift. We describe the algorithm implementation and provide a proof of concept using the first public data release from the VIMOS Public Extragalactic Redshift Survey (VIPERS PDR-1). We validate the method by comparing against the standard empirical redshift distribution code Trees for Photo-Z (TPZ) on both mock and real data.

The analysis allows us to properly account for galaxies in the tails of the distributions that would otherwise be classified as catastrophic outliers.

In order to fully exploit the potential of these datasets, it is important to understand the systematic effects associated with the instrument and the analysis pipeline. A common approach to tackle this is to forward-model the entire system-from the hardware to the analysis of the data products. For this purpose, we introduce two newly developed, open-source Python packages: the HI Data Emulator (HIDE) and the Signal Extraction and Emission Kartographer (SEEK) for simulating and processing single-dish radio survey data. HIDE forward-models the process of collecting astronomical radio signals in a single-dish radio telescope instrument and outputs pixel-level time-ordered-data. SEEK processes the time-ordered-data, removes artifacts from Radio Frequency Interference (RFI), automatically applies flux calibration, and aims to recover the astronomical radio signal. The two packages can be used separately or together depending on the application. Their modular and flexible nature allows easy adaptation to other instruments and datasets. We describe the basic architecture of the two packages and examine in detail the noise and RFI modeling in HIDE, as well as the implementation of gain calibration and RFI mitigation in SEEK. We then apply HIDE &SEEK to forward-model a Galactic survey in the frequency range 990-1260 MHz based on data taken at the Bleien Observatory. For this survey, we expect to cover 70% of the full sky and achieve a median signal-to-noise ratio of approximately 5-6 in the cleanest channels including systematic uncertainties. However, we also point out the potential challenges of high RFI contamination and baseline removal when examining the early data from the Bleien Observatory. The fully documented HIDE &SEEK packages are available at http://hideseek.phys.ethz.ch/ and are published under the GPLv3 license on GitHub.","read_count":52,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14919830","page":["8"],"bibcode":"2017A&C....18....8A","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Akeret, J.","Seehars, S.","Chang, C.","Monstein, C.","Amara, A.","Refregier, A."],"aff":["ETH Zurich, Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, Wolfgang Pauli Strasse 27, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland","ETH Zurich, Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, Wolfgang Pauli Strasse 27, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland","ETH Zurich, Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, Wolfgang Pauli Strasse 27, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland","ETH Zurich, Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, Wolfgang Pauli Strasse 27, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland","ETH Zurich, Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, Wolfgang Pauli Strasse 27, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland","ETH Zurich, Institute for Astronomy, Department of Physics, Wolfgang Pauli Strasse 27, 8093 Zurich, Switzerland"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","0000-0002-3178-363X","-","-"],"volume":"18","doi":["10.1016/j.ascom.2016.11.001"],"pub":"Astronomy and Computing","keyword":["Radio cosmology","Forward modeling","RFI mitigation","HIDE","SEEK","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"doctype":"article","title":["HIDE & SEEK: End-to-end packages to simulate and process radio survey data"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T19:47:47.130Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161100117B"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161100117B","2017A&C....18....1B","10.1016/j.ascom.2016.10.001","10.1016/j.ascom.2016.10.001","1611.00117","2016arXiv161100117B"],"first_author":"Bhattacharya, S.","abstract":"The morphology and cluster membership of the Galactic open clusters-Czernik 20 and NGC 1857 were analyzed using two different clustering algorithms.

The region of analysis has also been spatially classified using a statistical membership determination algorithm. We utilized near infrared (NIR) data for a suitably large region around the clusters from the United Kingdom Infrared Deep Sky Survey Galactic Plane Survey star catalogue database, and also from the Two Micron All Sky Survey star catalogue database. The densest regions of the cluster morphologies (1 for Czernik 20 and 2 for NGC 1857) thus identified were analyzed with a K-band extinction map and color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs). To address significant discrepancy in known distance and reddening parameters, we carried out field decontamination of these CMDs and subsequent isochrone fitting of the cleaned CMDs to obtain reliable distance and reddening parameters for the clusters (Czernik 20: D = 2900 pc; E(J- K) = 0 . 33; NGC 1857: D = 2400 pc; E(J- K) =0.18-0.19). The isochrones were also used to convert the luminosity functions for the densest regions of Czernik 20 and NGC 1857 into mass function, to derive their slopes. Additionally, a previously unknown over-density consistent with that of a star cluster is identified in the region of analysis.","read_count":20,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14919825","page":["1"],"bibcode":"2017A&C....18....1B","pubdate":"2017-01-00","copyright":"(c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.","author":["Bhattacharya, S.","Mahulkar, V.","Pandaokar, S.","Singh, P.

Molecular lines and line ratios are commonly used to infer properties of extra-galactic star forming regions. The new generation of millimeter receivers almost turns every observation into a line survey. Full exploitation of this technical advancement in extra-galactic study requires detailed bench-marking of available line diagnostics. <BR /> Aims: We aim to develop the Orion B giant molecular cloud (GMC) as a local template for interpreting extra-galactic molecular line observations. <BR /> Methods: We use the wide-band receiver at the IRAM-30 m to spatially and spectrally resolve the Orion B GMC. The observations cover almost 1 square degree at 26'' resolution with a bandwidth of 32 GHz from 84 to 116 GHz in only two tunings. Among the mapped spectral lines are the , , C<SUP>18</SUP>O, C<SUP>17</SUP>O, HCN, HNC, , C<SUB>2</SUB>H, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0), and , , SiO, c - C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH (2-1) transitions. <BR /> Results: We introduce the molecular anatomy of the Orion B GMC, including relationships between line intensities and gas column density or far-UV radiation fields, and correlations between selected line and line ratios. We also obtain a dust-traced gas mass that is less than approximately one third the CO-traced mass, using the standard X<SUB>CO</SUB> conversion factor. The presence of over-luminous CO can be traced back to the dependence of the CO intensity on UV illumination. As a matter of fact, while most lines show some dependence on the UV radiation field, CN and C<SUB>2</SUB>H are the most sensitive. Moreover, dense cloud cores are almost exclusively traced by N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>. Other traditional high-density tracers, such as HCN(1-0), are also easily detected in extended translucent regions at a typical density of 500 H<SUB>2</SUB> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. In general, we find no straightforward relationship between line critical density and the fraction of the line luminosity coming from dense gas regions. <BR /> Conclusions: Our initial findings demonstrate that the relationships between line (ratio) intensities and environment in GMCs are more complicated than often assumed. Sensitivity (I.e., the molecular column density), excitation, and, above all, chemistry contribute to the observed line intensity distributions, and they must be considered together when developing the next generation of extra-galactic molecular line diagnostics of mass, density, temperature, and radiation field.","citation_count":15,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917344","page":["A98"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...599A..98P","bibgroup":["NRAO","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Pety, Jérôme","Guzmán, Viviana V.","Orkisz, Jan H.","Liszt, Harvey S.","Gerin, Maryvonne","Bron, Emeric","Bardeau, Sébastien","Goicoechea, Javier R.","Gratier, Pierre","Le Petit, Franck","Levrier, François","Öberg, Karin I.","Roueff, Evelyne","Sievers, Albrecht"],"aff":["IRAM, 300 rue de la Piscine, 38406, Saint-Martin-d'Hères, France ; LERMA, Observatoire de Paris, PSL Research University, CNRS, Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ.

We obtained near-infrared observations and re-analyzed data from the VISTA/VVV survey to outline the brightness evolution. In our VLT/NaCO images, we discovered a halo of scattered light around V346 Nor with a size of about 0\".04 (30 au). The VISTA data outlined a well-defined minimum in the light curve in late 2010/early 2011, and tentatively revealed a small-amplitude periodic modulation of 58 days. Our latest data points from 2016 demonstrate that the source is still brightening but has not yet reached the 2008 level. We used a simple accretion disk model with varying accretion rate and line-of-sight extinction to reproduce the observed near-infrared magnitudes and colors. We found that the flux changes of V346 Nor before 2008 were caused by a correlated change of extinction and accretion rate, while the minimum around 2010 was mostly due to decreasing accretion. The source reached a highest accretion rate of ≈ 10<SUP>-4</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP> in 1992. A combination of accretion and extinction changes has been invoked in the literature to interpret the flux variations of certain embedded young eruptive stars.

The rotation history of the Crab Pulsar is well described by (1) a rotation frequency ν and a slowdown model that is specified by its first two time derivatives dot ν and ddot ν, known as the secular slowdown model; (2) occasional (once in ≈2 yr) significant and abrupt increases in the magnitude of ν and dot ν (occurring on timescales of minutes), known as glitches; and (3) much slower increases and decreases in ν and dot ν (occurring over months and years) that are an order of magnitude smaller, known as timing noise. <BR /> Aims: This work reports a speed-up event in the Crab Pulsar that occurred around 2015 February that is distinct from glitches and timing noise. <BR /> Methods: Monthly νs and dot νs of the Crab Pulsar, obtained at radio frequencies and published by Jodrell Bank Observatory (JBO), are used to demonstrate the speed-up event. Monthly arrival times of the Crab Pulsar's pulse, also published by JBO, combined with X-ray data from the RXTE, Swift, and NuSTAR observatories are used to verify the result. <BR /> Results: The speed-up event is caused by a persistent increase in dot ν, which results in a monotonic increase in ν. Over the last ≈550 days, ν has increased monotonically by an amount that is ≈10 times larger than the timing noise level. <BR /> Conclusions: This is a unique event in the Crab Pulsar. This is probably due to a small increase in the Crab Pulsar's internal temperature. In its absence, the next large glitch in the Crab Pulsar is expected to occur around 2019 March.

Clear simultaneously uses three deformable mirrors, each conjugated to a different altitude, to compensate for atmospheric turbulence. While the MCAO correction was most effective over an angle that is approximately three times wider than the angle that was corrected by CAO, the full 53'' field of view did benefit from MCAO correction. We further demonstrate that ground-layer-only correction is attractive for solar observations as a complementary flavor of adaptive optics for observational programs that require homogenous seeing improvement over a wide field rather than diffraction-limited resolution.

It is best reproduced by models of a non-eccentric ring with an inclination of 80 ± 1°, a position angle of -93 ± 1°, and a semi-major axis of 59 ± 3 au.

With approximately 70 magnetic OB stars known, any new object with unusual characteristics may turn out to be a key piece of the puzzle. We report the detection of an exceptionally strong magnetic field in the He-strong B2IV star CPD -62° 2124. Spectropolarimetric FORS2 and HARPSpol observations were analysed by two independent teams and procedures, concluding on a strong longitudinal magnetic field of approximately 5.2 kG. The quantitative characterisation of the stellar atmosphere yields an effective temperature of 23 650 ± 250 K, a surface gravity of 3.95 ± 0.10 dex and a surface helium fraction of 0.35 ± 0.02 by number. The metal composition is in agreement with the cosmic abundance standard, except for Mg, Si and S, which are slightly non-solar. The strong and broad ( 300 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) disc-like emission displayed by the Hα line suggests a centrifugal magnetosphere supported by the strong magnetic field. Our results imply that CPD -62° 2124 is an early B-type star hosting one of the strongest magnetic fields discovered to date, and one of the most evolved He-strong stars known, with a fractional main-sequence lifetime of approximately 0.6.

Quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) typically display periodic and regular peaks in the light curves during the flare emissions. Sometimes, QPPs show multiple periods at the same wavelength. However, changing periods in various channels are rare. <BR /> Aims: We report QPPs in a solar flare on 2014 October 27. They showed a period change that depended on whether thermal or nonthermal components were included. The flare was simultaneously observed by many instruments. <BR /> Methods: Using the fast Fourier transform (FFT), we decomposed the light curves at multiple wavelengths into slowly varying and rapidly varying signals. Then we identified the QPPs as the regular and periodic peaks from the rapidly varying signals. The periods are derived with the wavelet method and confirmed based on the FFT spectra of the rapidly varying signals. <BR /> Results: We find a period of 50 s from the thermal emissions during the impulsive phase of the flare, that is, in the soft X-ray bands. At the same time, a period of about 100 s is detected from the nonthermal emissions, such as hard X-ray and microwave channels. The period ratio is exactly 2.0, which might be due to the modulations of the magnetic reconnection rate by the fundamental and harmonic modes of magnetohydrodynamic waves. Our results further show that the 100 s period is present over a broad wavelength, such as hard X-rays, extreme-UV/UV, and microwave emissions, indicating the periodic magnetic reconnection in this flare. <BR /> Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first report about period changes from thermal to nonthermal components in a single flare that occur at almost the same time.

Stellar spectroscopy provides useful information on the physical properties of stars such as effective temperature, metallicity and surface gravity. However, those photospheric characteristics are often hampered by systematic uncertainties. The joint spectro-sismo project (APOGEE+Kepler, aka APOKASC) of field red giants has revealed a puzzling offset between the surface gravities (log g) determined spectroscopically and those determined using asteroseismology, which is largely dependent on the stellar evolutionary status. <BR /> Aims: Therefore, in this letter, we aim to shed light on the spectroscopic source of the offset. <BR /> Methods: We used the APOKASC sample to analyse the dependencies of the log g discrepancy as a function of stellar mass and stellar evolutionary status. We discuss and study the impact of some neglected abundances on spectral analysis of red giants, such as He and carbon isotopic ratio. <BR /> Results: We first show that, for stars at the bottom of the red giant branch where the first dredge-up had occurred, the discrepancy between spectroscopic log g and asteroseismic log g depends on stellar mass. This seems to indicate that the log g discrepancy is related to CN cycling. Among the CN-cycled elements, we demonstrate that the carbon isotopic ratio (<SUP>12</SUP>C /<SUP>13</SUP>C) has the largest impact on stellar spectrum. In parallel, we observe that this log g discrepancy shows a similar trend as the <SUP>12</SUP>C /<SUP>13</SUP>C ratios as expected by stellar evolution theory. Although we did not detect a direct spectroscopic signature of <SUP>13</SUP>C, other corroborating evidences suggest that the discrepancy in log g is tightly correlated to the production of <SUP>13</SUP>C in red giants. Moreover, by running the data-driven algorithm (the Cannon) on a synthetic grid trained on the APOGEE data, we try to evaluate more quantitatively the impact of various <SUP>12</SUP>C /<SUP>13</SUP>C ratios. <BR /> Conclusions: While we have demonstrated that <SUP>13</SUP>C indeed impacts all parameters, the size of the impact is smaller than the observed offset in log g. If further tests confirm that <SUP>13</SUP>C is not the main element responsible of the log g problem, the number of spectroscopic effects remaining to be investigated is now relatively limited (if any).","read_count":34,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917624","page":["L3"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597L...3M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Masseron, T.","Hawkins, K."],"aff":["Institute of Astronomy, Madingley Road, Cambridge, CB3 0HA, UK","Institute of Astronomy, Madingley Road, Cambridge, CB3 0HA, UK; Department of Astronomy, Columbia University, 550 W 120th St, New York, NY 10027, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"orcid_other":["-","0000-0002-1423-2174"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629938"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["stars: atmospheres","stars: fundamental parameters","stars: evolution","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis work was partly supported by the European Union FP7 programme through ERC grant number 320360.

For three observed images, it is possible to recover the convergence ratios and reduced shears identically.

We report new observations of the nearest solar-type stars α Centauri A (G2V) and B (K1V) with the VLTI/PIONIER optical interferometer. The combination of four configurations of the VLTI enable us to measure simultaneously the limb darkened angular diameter θ<SUB>LD</SUB> and the limb darkening parameters of the two solar-type stars in the near-infrared H band (λ = 1.65 μm). We obtain photospheric angular diameters of θ<SUB>LD</SUB>(A) = 8.502 ± 0.038 mas (0.43%) and θ<SUB>LD</SUB>(B) = 5.999 ± 0.025 mas (0.42%), through the adjustment of a power law limb darkening model. We find H band power law exponents of α(A) = 0.1404 ± 0.0050 (3.6%) and α(B) = 0.1545 ± 0.0044 (2.8%), which closely bracket the observed solar value (α<SUB>☉</SUB> = 0.15027). Combined with the parallax π = 747.17 ± 0.61 mas previously determined, we derive linear radii of R<SUB>A</SUB> = 1.2234 ± 0.0053 R<SUB>☉</SUB> (0.43%) and R<SUB>B</SUB> = 0.8632 ± 0.0037 R<SUB>☉</SUB> (0.43%). The power law exponents that we derive for the two stars indicate a significantly weaker limb darkening than predicted by both 1D and 3D stellar atmosphere models. As this discrepancy is also observed on the near-infrared limb darkening profile of the Sun, an improvement of the calibration of stellar atmosphere models is clearly needed. The reported PIONIER visibility measurements of α Cen A and B provide a robust basis to validate the future evolutions of these models.

The goal is to map to the angular and spectral resolution of FAST a large swath of the sky by simple drift scans with a transverse set of beams. This approach would be complementary to galaxy surveys and could be completed before the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) could begin a more detailed and precise effort. The science would be to measure the large-scale structure on the size of the baryon acoustic oscillations and larger scale, and the results would be complementary to its contemporary observations and significant. The survey would be uniquely sensitive to the potential very large-scale features from inflation at the Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale and complementary to observations of the cosmic microwave background.","read_count":28,"citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917752","page":["A136"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.136S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Smoot, George F.","Debono, Ivan"],"aff":["Paris Centre for Cosmological Physics, APC, AstroParticule et Cosmologie, Université Paris Diderot, CNRS/IN2P3, CEA/lrfu, Observatoire de Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cité, 10 rue Alice Domon et Léonie Duquet, 75205, Paris Cedex 13, France; Physics Department and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, CA, 94720, USA ; Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong","Paris Centre for Cosmological Physics, APC, AstroParticule et Cosmologie, Université Paris Diderot, CNRS/IN2P3, CEA/lrfu, Observatoire de Paris, Sorbonne Paris Cité, 10 rue Alice Domon et Léonie Duquet, 75205, Paris Cedex 13, France"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"orcid_other":["-","0000-0002-4699-5408"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201526794"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["methods: observational","inflation","radio continuum: galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nG.F.S. acknowledges support through his Chaire d’Excellence Université Sorbonne Paris Cité and the financial support of the UnivEarthS Labex programme at Université Sorbonne Paris Cité (ANR-10-LABX-0023 and ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02).

Automated arc detection methods are needed to scan the ongoing and next-generation wide-field imaging surveys, which are expected to contain thousands of strong lensing systems. Arc finders are also required for a quantitative comparison between predictions and observations of arc abundance. Several algorithms have been proposed to this end, but machine learning methods have remained as a relatively unexplored step in the arc finding process. <BR /> Aims: In this work we introduce a new arc finder based on pattern recognition, which uses a set of morphological measurements that are derived from the Mediatrix filamentation method as entries to an artificial neural network (ANN). We show a full example of the application of the arc finder, first training and validating the ANN on simulated arcs and then applying the code on four Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of strong lensing systems. <BR /> Methods: The simulated arcs use simple prescriptions for the lens and the source, while mimicking HST observational conditions. We also consider a sample of objects from HST images with no arcs in the training of the ANN classification. We use the training and validation process to determine a suitable set of ANN configurations, including the combination of inputs from the Mediatrix method, so as to maximize the completeness while keeping the false positives low. <BR /> Results: In the simulations the method was able to achieve a completeness of about 90% with respect to the arcs that are input into the ANN after a preselection. However, this completeness drops to 70% on the HST images. The false detections are on the order of 3% of the objects detected in these images. <BR /> Conclusions: The combination of Mediatrix measurements with an ANN is a promising tool for the pattern-recognition phase of arc finding. More realistic simulations and a larger set of real systems are needed for a better training and assessment of the efficiency of the method.","citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917640","page":["A135"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.135B","bibgroup":["HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Bom, C.

The galaxy population in the contemporary Universe is characterised by a clear bimodality, blue galaxies with significant ongoing star formation and red galaxies with only a little. The migration between the blue and the red cloud of galaxies is an issue of active research. Post starburst (PSB) galaxies are thought to be observed in the short-lived transition phase. <BR /> Aims: We aim to create a large sample of local PSB galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to study their characteristic properties, particularly morphological features indicative of gravitational distortions and indications for active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Another aim is to present a tool set for an efficient search in a large database of SDSS spectra based on Kohonen self-organising maps (SOMs). <BR /> Methods: We computed a huge Kohonen SOM for 10<SUP>6</SUP> spectra from SDSS data release 7. The SOM is made fully available, in combination with an interactive user interface, for the astronomical community. We selected a large sample of PSB galaxies taking advantage of the clustering behaviour of the SOM. The morphologies of both PSB galaxies and randomly selected galaxies from a comparison sample in SDSS Stripe 82 (S82) were inspected on deep co-added SDSS images to search for indications of gravitational distortions. We used the Portsmouth galaxy property computations to study the evolutionary stage of the PSB galaxies and archival multi-wavelength data to search for hidden AGNs. <BR /> Results: We compiled a catalogue of 2665 PSB galaxies with redshifts z < 0.4, among them 74 galaxies in S82 with EW(Hδ) > 3 Å and z < 0.25. In the colour-mass diagram, the PSB sample is clearly concentrated towards the region between the red and the blue cloud, in agreement with the idea that PSB galaxies represent the transitioning phase between actively and passively evolving galaxies. The relative frequency of distorted PSB galaxies is at least 57% for EW(Hδ) > 5 Å, significantly higher than in the comparison sample. The search for AGNs based on conventional selection criteria in the radio and MIR results in a low AGN fraction of 2-3%. We confirm an MIR excess in the mean SED of the E+A sample that may indicate hidden AGNs, though other sources are also possible.

We followed the evolution of spicules triggered by pulses that are launched in a vertical velocity component from the upper chromosphere. Then we compared the results obtained with and without non-adiabatic terms in the MHD equations. <BR /> Results: Our numerical results reveal that the velocity pulse is steepened into a shock that propagates upward into the corona. The chromospheric cold and dense plasma follows the shock and rises into the corona with the mean speed of 20-25 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The nonlinear wake behind the pulse in the stratified atmosphere leads to quasi-periodic rebound shocks, which lead to quasi-periodic rising of chromospheric plasma into the corona with a period close to the acoustic cut-off period of the chromosphere. We found that the effect of non-adiabatic terms on spicule evolution is minor; the general properties of spicules such as their heights and rising-time remain slightly affected by these terms. <BR /> Conclusions: In the framework of the axisymmetric model we devised, we show that the solar spicules can be triggered by the vertical velocity pulses, and thermal conduction and radiative cooling terms do not exert any significant influence on the dynamics of these spicules.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14917700","page":["A133"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.133K","identifier":["2017A&A...597A.133K","10.1051/0004-6361/201628747","10.1051/0004-6361/201628747"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kuźma, B.","Murawski, K.","Zaqarashvili, T.

We compare the observations with multiple disk models based on the spectral energy distribution (SED) and submm interferometry and find that an inner rim of the outer disk at 30 AU containing small silicate grains produces a polarized intensity signal which is an order of magnitude larger than observed. We show that a model in which the small dust grains extend smoothly into the cavity found for large grains is closer to the actual H-band observations.

The computational core of this method is linear regression between pairs of frequency maps, often called T-T plots. Individual contributions from monopole and dipole terms are determined by performing the regression locally in patches on the sky, while the degeneracy between different frequencies is lifted whenever the dominant foreground component exhibits a significant spatial spectral index variation. Based on this method, we present two different, but each internally consistent, sets of monopole and dipole coefficients for the nine-year WMAP, Planck 2013, SFD 100 μm, Haslam 408 MHz and Reich & Reich 1420 MHz maps. The two sets have been derived with different analysis assumptions and data selection, and provide an estimate of residual systematic uncertainties. In general, our values are in good agreement with previously published results. Among the most notable results are a relative dipole between the WMAP and Planck experiments of 10-15μK (depending on frequency), an estimate of the 408 MHz map monopole of 8.9 ± 1.3 K, and a non-zero dipole in the 1420 MHz map of 0.15 ± 0.03 K pointing towards Galactic coordinates (l,b) = (308°,-36°) ± 14°.

Dust emission maps from 60 to 850 μm are obtained from observations with the Spectral and Photometric Imaging Receiver (SPIRE) and carried out within the Herschel Virgo Cluster Survey (HeViCS); these are complemented by IRAS and Planck maps. Data from the Arecibo legacy Fast ALFA Survey is used to derive atomic gas column densities for two broad velocity components: low and intermediate velocity clouds. Dust emissivities are derived for each gas component and each far-infrared/submm band. For the low velocity clouds, we measure an average emissivity ∊<SUP>LVC</SUP><SUB>ν</SUB> = (0.79 ± 0.08) × 10<SUP>-20</SUP> MJy sr<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP> at 250 μm. After fitting a modified blackbody to the available bands, we estimated a dust absorption cross section of τ<SUP>LVC</SUP><SUB>ν</SUB>/N<SUB>H I</SUB> = (0.49 ± 0.13) × 10<SUP>-25</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP> H<SUP>-1</SUP> at 250 μm (with dust temperature T = 20.4 ± 1.5 K and spectral index β = 1.53 ± 0.17). The results are in excellent agreement with those obtained by Planck over a much larger coverage of the high Galactic latitude cirrus (50% of the sky versus 0.2% in our work). For dust associated with intermediate velocity gas, we confirm earlier Planck results and find a higher temperature and lower emissivity and cross section. After subtracting the modeled components, we find regions at scales smaller than 20' in which the residuals deviate significantly from the average scatter, which is dominated by cosmic infrared background. These large residuals are most likely due to local variations in the cirrus dust properties or to high-latitude molecular clouds with average N<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> ≲ 10<SUP>20</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. We find no conclusive evidence for intracluster dust emission in Virgo.

Over the last few decades it has become more evident that binarity is a prevalent phenomenon amongst RV Tauri stars with a disc. This study is a contribution to comprehend the role of binarity upon late stages of stellar evolution. <BR /> Aims: In this paper we determine the binary status of six Galactic RV Tauri stars, namely DY Ori, EP Lyr, HP Lyr, IRAS 17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933, and TW Cam, which are surrounded by a dusty disc. The radial velocities are contaminated by high-amplitude pulsations. We disentangle the pulsations from the orbital signal in order to determine accurate orbital parameters. We also place them on the HR diagram, thereby establishing their evolutionary nature. <BR /> Methods: We used high-resolution spectroscopic time series obtained from the HERMES and CORALIE spectrographs mounted on the Flemish Mercator and Swiss Leonhard Euler Telescopes, respectively. An updated ASAS/AAVSO photometric time series is analysed to complement the spectroscopic pulsation search and to clean the radial velocities from the pulsations. The pulsation-cleaned orbits are fitted with a Keplerian model to determine the spectroscopic orbital parameters. We also calibrated a PLC relationship using type II cepheids in the LMC and apply the relation to our Galactic sample to obtain accurate distances and hence luminosities. <BR /> Results: All six of the Galactic RV Tauri stars included in this study are binaries with orbital periods ranging between 650 and 1700 days and with eccentricities between 0.2 and 0.6. The mass functions range between 0.08 to 0.55 M<SUB>☉</SUB> which points to an unevolved low-mass companion. In the photometric time series we detect a long-term variation on the timescale of the orbital period for IRAS 17038-4815, IRAS 09144-4933, and TW Cam. Our derived stellar luminosities indicate that all except DY Ori and EP Lyr are post-AGB stars. DY Ori and EP Lyr are likely examples of the recently discovered dusty post-RGB stars. <BR /> Conclusions: The orbital parameters strongly suggest that the evolution of these stars was interrupted by a strong phase of binary interaction during or even prior to the AGB. The observed eccentricities and long orbital periods among these stars provide a challenge to the standard theory of binary evolution.

The damped random walk (DRW) stochastic process is nowadays frequently used to model aperiodic light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A number of correlations between the DRW model parameters, the signal decorrelation timescale and amplitude, and the physical AGN parameters, such as the black hole mass or luminosity, have been reported. <BR /> Aims: We are interested in whether or not it is plausible to correctly measure the DRW parameters from a typical ground-based survey, and, in particular, in how accurate the recovered DRW parameters are compared to the input ones. <BR /> Methods: By means of Monte Carlo simulations of AGN light curves, we studied the impact of the light curve length, the source magnitude (the photometric properties of a survey), cadence, and additional light (e.g., from a host galaxy) on the DRW model parameters. <BR /> Results: The most significant finding is that currently existing surveys are going to return unconstrained DRW decorrelation timescales, because typical rest-frame data do not probe long enough timescales or the white noise part of the power spectral density for DRW. The experiment length must be at least ten times longer than the true DRW decorrelation timescale, being presumably in the vicinity of one year, thus meaning the necessity for AGN light curves measuring a minimum of 10 years (rest-frame). The DRW timescales for sufficiently long light curves are typically weakly biased, and the exact bias depends on the fitting method and used priors. The DRW amplitude is mostly affected by the photometric noise (the source magnitude or the signal-to-noise ratio), cadence, and the AGN host light. <BR /> Conclusions: Because the DRW parameters appear to be incorrectly determined from typically existing data, the reported correlations of the DRW variability and physical AGN parameters from other works seem unlikely to be correct. In particular, the anti-correlation of the DRW decorrelation timescale with redshift is a manifestation of the survey length being too short. Application of DRW to modeling typical AGN optical light curves is questioned.","read_count":41,"citation_count":11,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917646","page":["A128"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.128K","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kozłowski, Szymon"],"aff":["Warsaw University Observatory, Al.

Recently, however, it was reported that the source started to show a peculiar behavior: its X-ray flux decreased significantly and type I outbursts were missed in several cases. At the same time, the spin frequency of the neutron star, which had been increasing steadily since the end of the 2006 giant outburst, reached a plateau. Very recent observations indicate that the source is now starting to spin down. These observed phenomena have a striking similarity with those which took place 21 yr ago, just before the source displayed a sudden orbital phase shift of the outburst peak (1995). This historical event occurred at the time exactly between the two giant outbursts (1985 and 2006). These phenomena suggest the system to have an underlying periodicity of 10.5 yr between orbital phase shifts and/or giant outbursts. The suggested periodicity may reflect some long-period dynamics in the circumstellar disk of the Be star, due, e.g., to the Kozai-Lidov effect. A model generating such a periodic change of the Be disk, namely Kozai-Lidov oscillations in the Be disk, is discussed. If this behavior is really periodical, another phase shift of the X-ray outburst peak is predicted to occur around 2016 December.","read_count":25,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917698","page":["A124"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.124L","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Laplace, Eva","Mihara, Tatehiro","Moritani, Yuki","Nakajima, Motoki","Takagi, Toshihiro","Makishima, Kazuo","Santangelo, Andrea"],"aff":["Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik, University of Tübingen, Sand 1, 72076, Tübingen, Germany ; MAXI team, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, 351-0198, Saitama, Japan","MAXI team, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, 351-0198, Saitama, Japan","Kavli Institute for the Physics and Mathematics of the Universe (WPI), The University of Tokyo Institutes for Advanced Study, The University of Tokyo, Kashiwa, 277-8583, Chiba, Japan","School of Dentistry at Matsudo, Nihon University, 2-870-1, Sakaecho-nishi, Matsudo, 271-8587, Chiba, Japan","MAXI team, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, 351-0198, Saitama, Japan","MAXI team, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako, 351-0198, Saitama, Japan","Institut für Astronomie und Astrophysik, University of Tübingen, Sand 1, 72076, Tübingen, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629373"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["HEASARC:1","SIMBAD:10"],"keyword":["accretion","accretion disks","stars: neutron","X-rays: binaries","stars: individual: EXO 2030+375","stars: emission-line","Be","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis research has made use of the MAXI data provided by RIKEN, JAXA and the MAXI team; Swift/BAT transient monitor results provided by the Swift/BAT team and data from the Fermi/GBM pulsar project.

In the last decade several massive molecular gas reservoirs were found <100 kpc distance from active galactic nuclei (AGNs), residing in gas-rich companion galaxies.

We also carry out a comprehensive analysis of the cosmological galaxy formation model galform with the aim of characterising how typical the system of SMM J04135+10277 is and whether quasar-star-forming galaxy pairs may constitute an important stage in galaxy evolution.

To single out the environmental effects, we selected cluster and field elliptical galaxies according to their morphology. We compared physical and structural parameters of galaxies in the two environments and we derived the relationships between effective radius, surface brightness, stellar mass, and stellar mass density Σ<SUB>R<SUB>e</SUB></SUB> within the effective radius and central mass density Σ<SUB>1 kpc</SUB>, within 1 kpc radius. <BR /> Results: We find that the structure and the properties of cluster elliptical galaxies do not differ from those in the field: they are characterized by the same structural parameters at fixed mass and they follow the same scaling relations. On the other hand, the population of field elliptical galaxies at z 1.3 shows a significant lack of massive (ℳ<SUB>∗</SUB>> 2 × 10<SUP>11</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>) and large (R<SUB>e</SUB>> 4-5 kpc) elliptical galaxies with respect to the cluster. Nonetheless, at ℳ<SUB>∗</SUB>< 2 × 10<SUP>11</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>, the two populations are similar. The size-mass relation of cluster and field ellipticals at z 1.3 clearly defines two different regimes, above and below a transition mass m<SUB>t</SUB> ≃ 2-3 × 10<SUP>10</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>: at lower masses the relation is nearly flat (R<SUB>e</SUB> ∝ Μ<SUB>*</SUB><SUP>-0.1±0.2</SUP>), the mean radius is nearly constant at 1 kpc and, consequenly, Σ<SUB>R<SUB>e</SUB></SUB> ≃ Σ<SUB>1 kpc</SUB> while, at larger masses, the relation is R<SUB>e</SUB> ∝ Μ<SUB>*</SUB><SUP>0.64±0.09</SUP>. The transition mass marks the mass at which galaxies reach the maximum stellar mass density. Also the Σ<SUB>1 kpc</SUB>-mass relation follows two different regimes, above and below the transition mass (Σ<SUB>1 kpc</SUB> ∝ Μ<SUB>*</SUB><SUB>1.07<mt</SUB><SUP>0.64>mt</SUP>) defining a transition mass density Σ<SUB>1 kpc</SUB> ≃ 2-3 × 10<SUP>3</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB> pc<SUP>-2</SUP>. The effective stellar mass density Σ<SUB>R<SUB>e</SUB></SUB> does not correlate with mass; dense/compact galaxies can be assembled over a wide mass regime, independently of the environment. The central stellar mass density, Σ<SUB>1 kpc</SUB>, besides being correlated with the mass, is correlated to the age of the stellar population: the higher the central stellar mass density, the higher the mass, the older the age of the stellar population. <BR /> Conclusions: While we found some evidence of environmental effects on the elliptical galaxies as a population, we did not find differences between the intrinsic properties of cluster and field elliptical galaxies at comparable redshift. The structure and the shaping of elliptical galaxies at z 1.3 do not depend on the environment. However, a dense environment seems to be more efficient in assembling high-mass large ellipticals, much rarer in the field at this redshift.

The axisymmetric sample is defined to include SNRs with a double-sided, bilateral morphology, and also those with a one-sided morphology where one limb is much brighter than the other. Using a coordinate transformation technique, we insert a bubble-like model SNR into a model of the Galactic magnetic field. Since radio emission of SNRs is dominated by synchrotron emission and since this emission depends on the magnetic field and CRE distribution, we are able to simulate the SNR emission and compare this to data. We find that the quasi-perpendicular CRE acceleration case is much more consistent with the data than the quasi-parallel CRE acceleration case, with G327.6+14.6 (SN1006) being a notable exception. We propose that SN1006 may be a case where both quasi-parallel and quasi-perpendicular acceleration are simultaneously at play in a single SNR.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917628","page":["A121"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.121W","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["West, J.

We use a hemispherical comparison method where the sky is divided into two opposite hemispheres and the abundance distribution of the morphological types, T, are compared using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. By pointing the axis of symmetry of the hemisphere pairs to different directions in the sky, the KS statistic as a function of sky coordinates is obtained. For three samples of galaxies within around 100, 150, and 200 Mpc, we find a significant hemispherical asymmetry with a vanishingly small chance of occurring in an isotropic distribution. Astonishingly, regardless of this extreme significance, the observed hemispherical asymmetry for the three distance ranges is aligned with the celestial equator at the 97.1-99.8% confidence level and with the ecliptic at 94.6-97.6%, estimated using a Monte Carlo analysis. Shifting T values randomly within their uncertainties has a negligible effect on this result. When a magnitude limit of B ≤ 15 mag is applied to these samples, the galaxies within 100 Mpc show no significant anisotropy after randomization of T. However, the direction of the asymmetry in the samples within 150 and 200 Mpc and the same magnitude limit is found to be within an angular separation of 32 degrees from (l,b) = (123.7,24.6) with a 97.2% and 99.9% confidence level, respectively. This direction is only 2.6 degrees away from the celestial north pole. Unless the Local Universe has a significant anisotropic distribution of galaxy morphologies aligned with the orientation or the orbit of the Earth (which would be a challenge for the Cosmological Principle), our results show that there seems to be a systematic bias in the classification of galaxy morphological types between the data from the northern and the southern equatorial sky. Further studies are absolutely needed to find the exact source of this anisotropy.","read_count":49,"citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917619","page":["A120"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.120J","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Javanmardi, Behnam","Kroupa, Pavel"],"aff":["Argelander Institut für Astronomie der Universität Bonn, Auf dem Hügel 71, 53121, Bonn, Germany ; Helmholtz-Institut fuer Strahlen und Kernphysik, Nussallee 14-16, 53115, Bonn, Germany;","Helmholtz-Institut fuer Strahlen und Kernphysik, Nussallee 14-16, 53115, Bonn, Germany; Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Astronomical Institute, V Holešovičkách 2, 180 00, Praha 8, Czech Republic"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"orcid_other":["0000-0002-9317-6114","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629408"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["SIMBAD:2"],"keyword":["galaxies: structure","galaxies: statistics","galaxies: abundances","cosmology: observations","methods: data analysis","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the referee for the critical and constructive comments.

Highly collimated jets and wide-angle outflows are two related components of the mass-ejection activity associated with stellar birth. Despite decades of research, the relation between these two components remains poorly understood. <BR /> Aims: We study the relation between the jet and the outflow in the IRAS 04166+2706 protostar. This Taurus protostar drives a molecular jet that contains multiple emission peaks symmetrically located from the central source. The protostar also drives a wide-angle outflow consisting of two conical shells. <BR /> Methods: We have used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) interferometer to observe two fields along the IRAS 04166+2706 jet. The fields were centered on a pair of emission peaks that correspond to the same ejection event. The observations were carried out in CO(2-1), SiO(5-4), and SO(J<SUB>N</SUB> = 6<SUB>5</SUB>-5<SUB>4</SUB>). <BR /> Results: Both ALMA fields present spatial distributions that are approximately elliptical and have their minor axes aligned with the jet direction. As the velocity increases, the emission in each field moves gradually across the elliptical region. This systematic pattern indicates that the emitting gas in each field lies in a disk-like structure that is perpendicular to the jet axis and whose gas is expanding away from the jet. A small degree of curvature in the first-moment maps indicates that the disks are slightly curved in the manner expected for bow shocks moving away from the IRAS source. A simple geometrical model confirms that this scenario fits the main emission features. <BR /> Conclusions: The emission peaks in the IRAS 04166+2706 jet likely represent internal bow shocks where material is being ejected laterally away from the jet axis. While the linear momentum of the ejected gas is dominated by the component in the jet direction, the sideways component is not negligible, and can potentially affect the distribution of gas in the surrounding outflow and core.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917612","page":["A119"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.119T","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes","ALMA","Spitzer","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Tafalla, M.","Su, Y. -N.","Shang, H.","Johnstone, D.","Zhang, Q.","Santiago-García, J.","Lee, C. -F.","Hirano, N.","Wang, L. -Y."],"aff":["Observatorio Astronómico Nacional (IGN), Alfonso XII 3, 28014, Madrid, Spain","Academia Sinica, Institute of Astrophysics (ASIAA), and Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics (TIARA), Academia Sinica, 11F of Astronomy-Mathematics Building, AS/NTU, No.1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan","Academia Sinica, Institute of Astrophysics (ASIAA), and Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics (TIARA), Academia Sinica, 11F of Astronomy-Mathematics Building, AS/NTU, No.1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan","National Research Council of Canada, Herzberg Astronomy & Astrophysics, 5071 West Saanich Road, Victoria, BC, V9E 2E7, Canada; Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Victoria, Victoria, BC, V8P 1A1, Canada","Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, 60 Garden Street, Cambridge, MA, 02138, USA","Instituto de Radioastronomía Milimétrica (IRAM), Avenida Divina Pastora 7, Núcleo Central, 18012, Granada, Spain","Academia Sinica, Institute of Astrophysics (ASIAA), and Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics (TIARA), Academia Sinica, 11F of Astronomy-Mathematics Building, AS/NTU, No.1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan","Academia Sinica, Institute of Astrophysics (ASIAA), and Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics (TIARA), Academia Sinica, 11F of Astronomy-Mathematics Building, AS/NTU, No.1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan","Academia Sinica, Institute of Astrophysics (ASIAA), and Theoretical Institute for Advanced Research in Astrophysics (TIARA), Academia Sinica, 11F of Astronomy-Mathematics Building, AS/NTU, No.1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Rd, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, National Taiwan University, No. 1, Sec. 4, Roosevelt Road, Taipei, 10617, Taiwan"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"orcid_other":["-","-","-","-","0000-0003-2384-6589","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629493"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["ALMA:1","SIMBAD:8"],"keyword":["stars: formation","ISM: individual objects: IRAS 04166+2706","ISM: jets and outflows","ISM: molecules","radio lines: ISM","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank Miguel Santander-García for help with the programs Shape (Steffen et al. 2011) and Shapemol (Santander-García et al. 2015), which were used for the initial modeling of the data and in two figures.

Basic physical attributes of G181.1+9.5 calculated with radiative SNR models show an upper-limit age of 16 000 yr, a swept-up mass of more than 300M<SUB>☉</SUB>, and an ambient density in agreement with that estimated from H I observations. <BR /> Conclusions: G181.1+9.5 shows all characteristics of a typical mature shell-type SNR, but its observed faintness is unusual and requires further study.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917715","page":["A116"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.116K","bibgroup":["CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kothes, Roland","Reich, Patricia","Foster, Tyler J.","Reich, Wolfgang"],"aff":["National Research Council Canada, Herzberg Programs in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory, PO Box 248, Penticton, British Columbia, V2A 6J9, Canada","Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie, Auf dem Hügel 69, 53121, Bonn, Germany","Department of Physics and Astronomy, Brandon University, 270 18th Street, Brandon, MB, R7A 6A9, Canada","Max-Planck-Institut für Radioastronomie, Auf dem Hügel 69, 53121, Bonn, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629848"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["SIMBAD:15"],"keyword":["polarization","ISM: magnetic fields","ISM: supernova remnants","ISM: individual objects: G181.1+9.5","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe wish to thank Dr. Tom Landecker (DRAO) and Prof. Ernst Fürst (MPIfR) for careful reading of the manuscript.

Differential flux upper limits as function of the photon energy were derived and used to constrain the intrinsic high-energy afterglow emission of FRB 150418. <BR /> Conclusions: No hints for high-energy afterglow emission of FRB 150418 were found. Taking absorption on the extragalactic background light into account and assuming a distance of z = 0.492 based on radio and optical counterpart studies and consistent with the FRB dispersion, we constrain the gamma-ray luminosity at 1 TeV to L < 5.1 × 10<SUP>47</SUP> erg/s at 99% C.L.","read_count":57,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917738","page":["A115"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.115H","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["H.

This will produce a catalogue of over-densities. <BR /> Methods: The minimum spanning tree (MST) method was used to identify the over-densities in two dimensions. The catalogue was further refined by folding in heliocentric distances, resulting in more reliable over-densities, which are cluster candidates. <BR /> Results: We found 1633 over-densities with more than ten members. Of these, 496 are defined as cluster candidates because of the reliability of the distances, with a further 1137 potential cluster candidates. The spatial distributions of the cluster candidates are different in the first and fourth quadrants, with all clusters following the spiral structure of the Milky Way.

J.","abstract":"The raw coronagraphic performance of current high-contrast imaging instruments is limited by the presence of a quasi-static speckle (QSS) background, resulting from instrumental Non-Common Path Errors (NCPEs). Rapid development of efficient speckle subtraction techniques in data reduction has enabled final contrasts of up to 10<SUP>-6</SUP> to be obtained, however it remains preferable to eliminate the underlying NCPEs at the source. In this work we introduce the coronagraphic Modal Wavefront Sensor (cMWS), a new wavefront sensor suitable for real-time NCPE correction. This combines the Apodizing Phase Plate (APP) coronagraph with a holographic modal wavefront sensor to provide simultaneous coronagraphic imaging and focal-plane wavefront sensing with the science point-spread function. We first characterise the baseline performance of the cMWS via idealised closed-loop simulations, showing that the sensor is able to successfully recover diffraction-limited coronagraph performance over an effective dynamic range of ±2.5 radians root-mean-square (rms) wavefront error within 2-10 iterations, with performance independent of the specific choice of mode basis. We then present the results of initial on-sky testing at the William Herschel Telescope, which demonstrate that the sensor is capable of NCPE sensing under realistic seeing conditions via the recovery of known static aberrations to an accuracy of 10 nm (0.1 radians) rms error in the presence of a dominant atmospheric speckle foreground. We also find that the sensor is capable of real-time measurement of broadband atmospheric wavefront variance (50% bandwidth, 158 nm rms wavefront error) at a cadence of 50 Hz over an uncorrected telescope sub-aperture. When combined with a suitable closed-loop adaptive optics system, the cMWS holds the potential to deliver an improvement of up to two orders of magnitude over the uncorrected QSS floor. Such a sensor would be eminently suitable for the direct imaging and spectroscopy of exoplanets with both existing and future instruments, including EPICS and METIS for the E-ELT.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917678","page":["A112"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.112W","bibgroup":["Leiden Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Wilby, M.

As prominences are believed to have a mean horizontal guide field, investigating any turbulence they host could shed light on the nature of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in a wide range of astrophysical systems. In this paper we have investigated the nature of the turbulent prominence motions using structure function analysis on the velocity increments estimated from Hα Dopplergrams constructed with observational data from Hinode Solar Optical Telescope (SOT). The probability density function of the velocity increments shows that as we look at increasingly small spatial separations the distribution displays greater departure from a reference Gaussian distribution, hinting at intermittency in the velocity field. Analysis of the even order structure functions for both the horizontal and vertical separations showed the existence of two distinct regions displaying different exponents of the power law with the break in the power law at approximately 2000 km. We hypothesise this to be a result of internal turbulence excited in the prominence by the dynamic flows of the system found at this spatial scale. We found that the scaling exponents of the pth order structure functions for these two regions generally followed the p/ 2 (smaller scales) and p/ 4 (larger scales) laws that are the same as those predicted for weak MHD turbulence and Kraichnan-Iroshnikov turbulence respectively. However, the existence of the p/ 4 scaling at larger scales than the p/ 2 scaling is inconsistent with the increasing nonlinearity expected in MHD turbulence. We also found that as we went to higher order structure functions, the dependence of the scaling exponent on the order p is nonlinear implying that intermittency may be playing an important role in the turbulent cascade. Estimating the heating from the turbulent energy dissipation showed that this turbulence would be very inefficient at heating the prominence plasma, but that the mass diffusion through turbulence driven reconnection was of the order of 10<SUP>10</SUP> cm<SUP>2</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>. This is of similar order to that of the expected value of the ambipolar diffusion and a few orders of magnitude greater than Ohmic diffusion for a quiescent prominence.

It is essential for a robust calibration of the mass-observable scaling relations and their scatter, which are key ingredients for precise cosmology using cluster statistics. Here we illustrate an application of high resolution (<20 arcsec) thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) observations by probing the intracluster medium (ICM) of the Planck-discovered galaxy cluster PSZ1 G045.85+57.71 at redshift z = 0.61, using tSZ data obtained with the NIKA camera, which is a dual-band (150 and 260 GHz) instrument operated at the IRAM 30-m telescope. We deproject jointly NIKA and Planck data to extract the electronic pressure distribution from the cluster core (R 0.02 R<SUB>500</SUB>) to its outskirts (R 3 R<SUB>500</SUB>) non-parametrically for the first time at intermediate redshift. The constraints on the resulting pressure profile allow us to reduce the relative uncertainty on the integrated Compton parameter by a factor of two compared to the Planck value. Combining the tSZ data and the deprojected electronic density profile from XMM-Newton allows us to undertake a hydrostatic mass analysis, for which we study the impact of a spherical model assumption on the total mass estimate. We also investigate the radial temperature and entropy distributions. These data indicate that PSZ1 G045.85+57.71 is a massive (M<SUB>500</SUB> 5.5 × 10<SUP>14</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>) cool-core cluster. This work is part of a pilot study aiming at optimizing the treatment of the NIKA2 tSZ large program dedicated to the follow-up of SZ-discovered clusters at intermediate and high redshifts. This study illustrates the potential of NIKA2 to put constraints on thethermodynamic properties and tSZ-scaling relations of these clusters, and demonstrates the excellent synergy between tSZ and X-ray observations of similar angular resolution.","citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917650","page":["A110"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.110R","bibgroup":["XMM","Herschel","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Ruppin, F.","Adam, R.","Comis, B.","Ade, P.","André, P.","Arnaud, M.","Beelen, A.","Benoît, A.","Bideaud, A.","Billot, N.","Bourrion, O.","Calvo, M.","Catalano, A.","Coiffard, G.","D'Addabbo, A.","De Petris, M.","Désert, F. -X.","Doyle, S.","Goupy, J.","Kramer, C.","Leclercq, S.","Macías-Pérez, J.

High resolution movies in 193 Å from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamic Observatory (SDO) show apparent rotation in the leg of a prominence observed during a coordinated campaign. Such structures are commonly referred to as tornadoes. Time-distance intensity diagrams of the AIA data show the existence of oscillations suggesting that the structure is rotating. <BR /> Aims: The aim of this paper is to understand if the cool plasma at chromospheric temperatures inside the tornado is rotating around its central axis. <BR /> Methods: The tornado was also observed in Hα with a cadence of 30 s by the MSDP spectrograph, operating at the Solar Tower in Meudon. The MSDP provides sequences of simultaneous spectra in a 2D field of view from which a cube of Doppler velocity maps is retrieved. <BR /> Results: The Hα Doppler maps show a pattern with alternatively blueshifted and redshifted areas of 5 to 10'' wide. Over time the blueshifted areas become redshifted and vice versa, with a quasi-periodicity of 40 to 60 min. Weaker amplitude oscillations with periods of 4 to 6 min are superimposed onto these large period oscillations. <BR /> Conclusions: The Doppler pattern observed in Hα cannot be interpreted as rotation of the cool plasma inside the tornado. The Hα velocity observations give strong constraints on the possible interpretations of the AIA tornado.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917693","page":["A109"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.109S","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Schmieder, B.","Mein, P.","Mein, N.","Levens, P.

The detailed spectral analysis of stellar populations of intermediate-redshift passive red galaxies allows the build up of their stellar content to be followed over the last 8 billion years. <BR /> Methods: We extracted a sample of passive red galaxies in the redshift range 0.4 <z< 1.0 and stellar mass range 10 < log (M<SUB>star</SUB>/M<SUB>☉</SUB>) < 12 from the VIPERS survey. The sample was selected using an evolving cut in the rest-frame U-V color distribution and additional cuts that ensured high quality. The spectra of passive red galaxies were stacked in narrow bins of stellar mass and redshift. We use the stacked spectra to measure the 4000 Å break (D4000) and the Hδ Lick index (Hδ<SUB>A</SUB>) with high precision. These spectral features are used as indicators of the star formation history of passive red galaxies. We compare the results with a grid of synthetic spectra to constrain the star formation epochs of these galaxies. We characterize the formation redshift-stellar mass relation for intermediate-redshift passive red galaxies. <BR /> Results: We find that at z 1 stellar populations in low-mass passive red galaxies are younger than in high-mass passive red galaxies, similar to what is observed at the present epoch. Over the full analyzed redshift range 0.4 < z < 1.0 and stellar mass range 10 < log (M<SUB>star</SUB>/M<SUB>☉</SUB>) < 12, the D4000 index increases with redshift, while Hδ<SUB>A</SUB> gets lower. This implies that the stellar populations are getting older with increasing stellar mass. Comparison to the spectra of passive red galaxies in the SDSS survey (z 0.2) shows that the shape of the relations of D4000 and Hδ<SUB>A</SUB> with stellar mass has not changed significantly with redshift. Assuming a single burst formation, this implies that high-mass passive red galaxies formed their stars at z<SUB>form</SUB> 1.7, while low-mass galaxies formed their main stellar populations more recently, at z<SUB>form</SUB> 1. The consistency of these results, which were obtained using two independent estimators of the formation redshift (D4000 and Hδ<SUB>A</SUB>), further strengthens a scenario in which star formation proceeds from higher to lower mass systems as time passes, I.e., what has become known as the downsizing picture.

This expansion measurement is carried out in the south-east region of the remnant, where two sharp filament structures are observed. For the outermost filament, the proper motion is arcsec yr<SUP>-1</SUP> which is equivalent to a shock speed of 3500 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at a distance of 1 kpc. In contrast with the bright north-west region, where the shock is interacting with the border of the cavity, the shock in the south-east region is probably expanding in the original ambient medium carved by the progenitor and can be used to derive the current density at the shock and the age of the remnant. In the case where the shock is evolving in a wind profile (ρ ∝ r<SUP>- s</SUP>, s = 2) or in a uniform medium (s = 0), we estimate an age of 2300 yr and 1800 yr respectively for an ejecta power-law index of n = 9. The specific case of an ejecta power-law index of n = 7, and s = 0, yields an age of 1500 yr, which would reconcile RX J1713.7-3946 with the historical records of SN 393. In all scenarios, we derive similar upstream densities of the order of 0.01 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, compatible with the lack of thermal X-rays from the shocked ambient medium.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917603","page":["A106"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.106A","bibgroup":["XMM","CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Acero, Fabio","Katsuda, Satoru","Ballet, Jean","Petre, Robert"],"aff":["Laboratoire AIM, IRFU/SAp - CEA/DRF - CNRS - Université Paris Diderot, Bât. 709, CEA-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France","Department of Physics, Faculty of Science & Engineering, Chuo University, 1-13-27 Kasuga, Bunkyo, 112-8551, Tokyo, Japan","Laboratoire AIM, IRFU/SAp - CEA/DRF - CNRS - Université Paris Diderot, Bât. 709, CEA-Saclay, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France","NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD, 20771, USA"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629618"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["CXO:2","HEASARC:1","SIMBAD:6"],"keyword":["ISM: supernova remnants","ISM: individual objects: RX J1713.7-3946","X-rays: ISM","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe acknowledge the use of several open-source libraries for Python, including Numpy, Matplotlib, and Astropy. \n","doctype":"article","read_count":26,"title":["Measurement of the X-ray proper motion in the south-east rim of RX J1713.7-3946"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-10T19:09:13.740Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv161101071F"],"identifier":["2016arXiv161101071F","2017A&A...597A.105F","10.1051/0004-6361/201629050","1611.01071","2016arXiv161101071F","10.1051/0004-6361/201629050"],"first_author":"Falstad, N.","abstract":"<BR /> Aims: We probe the physical conditions in the core of Arp 299A and try to put constraints on the nature of its nuclear power source. <BR /> Methods: We used Herschel Space Observatory far-infrared and submillimeter observations of H<SUB>2</SUB>O and OH rotational lines in Arp 299A to create a multi-component model of the galaxy.

We find that at least two components are required in order to account for the excited molecular line spectrum. The inner component has a radius of 20-25 pc, a very high infrared surface brightness (≳3 × 10<SUP>13</SUP>L<SUB>☉</SUB>kpc<SUP>-2</SUP>), warm dust (T<SUB>d</SUB> > 90 K), and a large H<SUB>2</SUB> column density (N<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB> > 10<SUP>24</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>).

The outer component is larger (50-100 pc) with slightly cooler dust (70-90 K) and molecular abundances that are approximately one order of magnitude lower.

Our results are consistent with a composite source. The high OH/H<SUB>2</SUB>O ratio in the nucleus indicates that ion-neutral chemistry induced by X-rays or cosmic-rays is important. Finally we find a lower limit to the <SUP>16</SUP>O/<SUP>18</SUP>O ratio of 400 in the nuclear region, possibly indicating that the nuclear starburst is in an early evolutionary stage, or that it is fed through a molecular inflow of, at most, solar metallicity.

The evolution of such counterrotating galaxies remains far from being well understood. In this paper we study the dynamics of counterrotating collisionless stellar disks by means of N-body simulations. We show that, in the presence of counterrotation, an otherwise gravitationally stable disk can naturally generate bending waves accompanied by strong disk heating across the disk plane, that is in the vertical direction. Such a conclusion is found to hold even for dynamically warm systems with typical values of the initial vertical-to-radial velocity dispersion ratio σ<SUB>z</SUB>/σ<SUB>R</SUB> ≈ 0.5, for which the role of pressure anisotropy should be unimportant. We note that, during evolution, the σ<SUB>z</SUB>/σ<SUB>R</SUB> ratio tends to rise up to values close to unity in the case of locally Jeans-stable disks, whereas in disks that are initially Jeans-unstable it may reach even higher values, especially in the innermost regions. This unusual behavior of the σ<SUB>z</SUB>/σ<SUB>R</SUB> ratio in galaxies with counterrotation appears not to have been noticed earlier. Our investigations of systems made of two counterrotating components with different mass-ratios suggest that even apparently normal disk galaxies (I.e., with a minor counterrotating component so as to escape detection in current observations) might be subject to significant disk heating especially in the vertical direction.","read_count":15,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917642","page":["A103"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A.103K","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Khoperskov, Sergey","Bertin, Giuseppe"],"aff":["GEPI, Observatoire de Paris, CNRS, Université Paris Diderot, 5 place Jules Janssen, 92190, Meudon, France ; Institute of Astronomy, Russian Academy of Sciences, 48 Pyatnitskaya st., 119017, Moscow, Russia","Dipartimento di Fisica, Università degli Studi di Milano, via Celoria 16, 20133, Milano, Italy"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629032"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["galaxies: evolution","galaxies: kinematics and dynamics","galaxies: structure","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe wish to thank the referee for thoughtful suggestions that have improved the quality of the paper.

The equivalent width of the Hα line from the least active hemisphere increased from ≈0.7 Å at the beginning of the observation to 1.0 Å at the end. The basal emission of the most active hemisphere remained roughly constant at EW<SUB>Hα</SUB>t1.0 Å. Intense flare activity was observed during the first twenty days, where at least four different events were detected. The line asymmetries of the Hα line suggest that one of the flares could have produced a mass ejection with a maximum projected speed of 70kms<SUP>-1</SUP>. The rotational modulation of the V-band photometry showed clear anti-correlation with the chromospheric activity.

That evolutionary phase is characterised by a very intense mass loss, the understanding of which is still very limited.

The emission from the <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 2-1 line, H30α recombination line, and continuum is imaged at a resolution of 8'', revealing the morphology of the molecular environment around the star.

The radio recombination line H30α shows unresolved emission at the star, with an approximately Gaussian spectrum centered on a velocity of 21 ± 3km s<SUP>-1</SUP> with a width of 57 ± 6km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. In contrast, the CO 2-1 emission is complex and decomposes into several components beyond the contamination from interstellar gas in the line of sight. The CO spectrum toward the star is a broad plateau, centered at the systemic velocity of +18 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and with an expansion velocity of 100 ± 10km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Assuming isotropic and constant mass-loss, we estimate a mass-loss rate of 8 ± 1.5 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>.

In addition, we find a puzzling bright feature radially connecting the star to the CO ring, at a velocity of +40 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> relative to the star.

The new generation of low-frequency radio telescopes, such as the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR: a Square Kilometre Array-low pathfinder), provides advancements in our capability of probing Galactic magnetism through low-frequency polarimetry. Maps of diffuse polarized radio emission and the associated Faraday rotation can be used to infer properties of, and trace structure in, the magnetic fields in the ISM. However, to date very little of the sky has been probed at high angular and Faraday depth resolution. We observed a 5° by 5° region centred on the nearby galaxy IC 342 (ℓ = 138.2°,b = + 10.6°) using the LOFAR high-band antennae in the frequency range 115-178 MHz. We imaged this region at 4'.5x3'.8 resolution and performed Faraday tomography to detect foreground Galactic polarized synchrotron emission separated by Faraday depth (different amounts of Faraday rotation). Our Faraday depth cube shows a rich polarized structure, with up to 30 K of polarized emission at 150 MHz. We clearly detect two polarized features that extend over most of the field, but are clearly separated in Faraday depth. Simulations of the behaviour of the depolarization of Faraday-thick structures at such low frequencies show that such structures would be too strongly depolarized to explain the observations. These structures are therefore rejected as the source of the observed polarized features. Only Faraday thin structures will not be strongly depolarized at low frequencies; producing such structures requires localized variations in the ratio of synchrotron emissivity to Faraday depth per unit distance. Such variations can arise from several physical phenomena, such as a transition between regions of ionized and (mostly) neutral gas. We conclude that the observed polarized emission is Faraday thin, and propose that the emission originates from two mostly neutral clouds in the local ISM. Using maps of the local ISM to estimate distances to these clouds, we have modelled the Faraday rotation for this line of sight and estimated that the strength of the line of sight component of magnetic field of the local ISM for this direction varies between -0.86 and+0.12 μG (where positive is towards the Earth). We propose that this may be a useful method for mapping magnetic fields within the local ISM in all directions towards nearby neutral clouds.

(2011, ApJS, 196, 11) to study how the bulge and disc components contribute to the parent galaxy's star formation activity, by determining its position in the star formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass (M<SUB>⋆</SUB>) plane at 0.02 < z < 0.1 and around the main sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies. For this purpose, we use the bulge and disc colours as proxy for their SFRs, while the total galaxy SFR comes from H<SUB>α</SUB> or D<SUB>4000</SUB>. We study the mean galaxy bulge-total mass ratio (B/T) as a function of the residual from the MS (∆<SUB>MS</SUB>) and find that the B/T-∆<SUB>MS</SUB> relation exhibits a parabola-like shape with the peak of the MS corresponding to the lowest B/Ts at any stellar mass. The lower and upper envelope of the MS are populated by galaxies with similar B/T, velocity dispersion and concentration (R<SUB>90</SUB>/R<SUB>50</SUB>) values. The mean values of such distributions indicate that the majority of the galaxies are characterised by classical bulges and not pseudo-bulges. Bulges above the MS are characterised by blue colours or, when red, by a high level of dust obscuration, thus indicating that in both cases they are actively star forming. When on the MS or below it, bulges are mostly red and dead. At stellar masses above 10<SUP>10.5</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>, bulges on the MS or in the green valley tend to be significantly redder than their counterparts in the quiescence region, despite similar levels of dust obscuration. This could be explained with different age or metallicity content, suggesting different evolutionary paths for bulges on the MS and green valley with respect to those in the quiescence region. The disc g-r colour anti-correlates at any mass with the distance from the MS, getting redder when approaching the MS lower envelope and the quiescence region. The anti-correlation flattens as a function of the stellar mass, likely due to a higher level of dust obscuration in massive SF galaxies. We conclude that the position of a galaxy in the Log SFR - Log M<SUB>⋆</SUB> plane depends on the star formation activity of its components: above the MS both bulge and disc are actively star forming. The nuclear activity is the first to be suppressed, moving the galaxies on the MS. Once the disc stops forming stars as well, the galaxy moves below the MS and eventually to the quiescence region. This is confirmed by a significant percentage ( 45%) of passive galaxies with a secure two component morphology, coexisting with a population of pure spheroidals. Our findings are qualitatively in agreement with the compaction-depletion scenario, in which subsequent phases of gas inflow in the centre of a galaxy and depletion due to high star formation activity move the galaxy across the MS before the final quenching episode takes place.","read_count":46,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917641","page":["A97"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..97M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Morselli, L.","Popesso, P.","Erfanianfar, G.","Concas, A."],"aff":["Excellence Cluster Universe, Boltzmannstr. 2, 85748, Garching bei München, Germany","Excellence Cluster Universe, Boltzmannstr. 2, 85748, Garching bei München, Germany","Excellence Cluster Universe, Boltzmannstr. 2, 85748, Garching bei München, Germany","Excellence Cluster Universe, Boltzmannstr. 2, 85748, Garching bei München, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629409"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["galaxies: evolution","galaxies: bulges","galaxies: star formation","galaxies: structure","galaxies: spiral","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the anonymous referee for useful comments that improved the manuscript.

These events have significant impact on the intra-cluster medium, depositing vast amounts of energy, often in the form of shocks, as well as heavily influencing the properties of the constituent galaxy population. Many clusters have been shown to host large-scale diffuse radio emission, known variously as radio haloes and relics. These sources arise as a result of electron (re-)acceleration in cluster-scale magnetic fields, although the processes by which this occurs are still poorly understood. <BR /> Aims: We present new, deep radio observations of the high-redshift galaxy cluster MACS J0025.4-1222, taken with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at 325 MHz, as well as a new analysis of all archival Chandra X-ray observations. We aim to investigate the potential of diffuse radio emission and categorise the radio population of this cluster, which has only been covered previously by shallow radio surveys. <BR /> Methods: We produced low-resolution maps of MACS J0025.4-1222 through a combination of uv-tapering and subtracting the compact source population. Radial surface brightness and mass profiles were derived from the Chandra data. We also derived a 2D map of the intracluster medium temperature. <BR /> Results: For the first time, two sources of diffuse radio emission are detected in MACS J0025.4-1222, on linear scales of several hundred kpc. Given the redshift of the cluster and the assumed cosmology, these sources appear to be consistent with established trends in power scaling relations for radio relics. The X-ray temperature map presents evidence of an asymmetric temperature profile and tentative identification of a temperature jump associated with one relic. <BR /> Conclusions: We classify the pair of diffuse radio sources in this cluster as a pair of radio relics, given their consistency with scaling relations, location toward the cluster outskirts, and the available X-ray data.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917708","page":["A96"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..96R","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes","CXC","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Riseley, C.

Our ground-based spectroscopic observations revealed no companion, therefore EPIC 211779126 is likely a single sdB star. Using p-mode multiplets, we derived a rotation period of approximately 16 days, making EPIC 211779126 the fastest rotating non-binary subdwarf B pulsator observed with Kepler. However, we do not find any resolved multiplets among the high-amplitude g-mode pulsations that correspond to the rotation rate inferred from the p-mode splittings.

Stellar activity and convection-related surface structures might cause bias in planet detection and characterization that use these transits. Surface convection simulations help to quantify the granulation signal. <BR /> Aims: We used realistic three-dimensional (3D) radiative hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations from the Stagger grid and synthetic images computed with the radiative transfer code Optim3D to model the transits of three prototype planets: a hot Jupiter, a hot Neptune, and a terrestrial planet. <BR /> Methods: We computed intensity maps from RHD simulations of the Sun and a K-dwarf star at different wavelength bands from optical to far-infrared that cover the range of several ground- and space-based telescopes which observe exoplanet transits. We modeled the transit using synthetic stellar-disk images obtained with a spherical-tile imaging method and emulated the temporal variation of the granulation intensity generating random images covering a granulation time-series of 13.3 h. We measured the contribution of the stellar granulation on the light curves during the planet transit. <BR /> Results: We identified two types of granulation noise that act simultaneously during the planet transit: (I) the intrinsic change in the granulation pattern with timescale (e.g., 10 min for solar-type stars assumed in this work) is smaller than the usual planet transit ( hours as in our prototype cases); and (II) the fact that the transiting planet occults isolated regions of the photosphere that differ in local surface brightness as a result of convective-related surface structures. First, we showed that our modeling approach returns granulation timescale fluctuations that are comparable with what has been observed for the Sun. Then, our statistical approach shows that the granulation pattern of solar and K-dwarf-type stars have a non-negligible effect of the light curve depth during the transit, and, consequentially on the determination of the planet transit parameters such as the planet radius (up to 0.90% and 0.47% for terrestrial and gaseous planets, respectively). We also showed that larger (or smaller) orbital inclination angles with respect to values corresponding to transit at the stellar center display a shallower transit depth and longer ingress and egress times, but also granulation fluctuations that are correlated to the center-to-limb variation: they increase (or decrease) the value of the inclination, which amplifies the fluctuations. The granulation noise appears to be correlated among the different wavelength ranges either in the visible or in the infrared regions. <BR /> Conclusions: The prospects for planet detection and characterization with transiting methods are excellent with access to large amounts of data for stars. The granulation has to be considered as an intrinsic uncertainty (as a result of stellar variability) on the precise measurements of exoplanet transits of planets. The full characterization of the granulation is essential for determining the degree of uncertainty on the planet parameters. In this context, the use of 3D RHD simulations is important to measure the convection-related fluctuations. This can be achieved by performing precise and continuous observations of stellar photometry and radial velocity, as we explained with RHD simulations, before, after, and during the transit periods.","read_count":30,"citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917739","page":["A94"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..94C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Chiavassa, A.","Caldas, A.","Selsis, F.","Leconte, J.","Von Paris, P.","Bordé, P.","Magic, Z.","Collet, R.","Asplund, M."],"aff":["Laboratoire Lagrange, Université Côte d'Azur, Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, CNRS, Bd de l'Observatoire, CS 34229, 06304, Nice Cedex 4, France","Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux, Univ.

Active regions (ARs) are the main sources of variety in solar dynamic events. Automated detection and identification tools need to be developed for solar features for a deeper understanding of the solar cycle. Of particular interest here are the dynamical properties of the ARs, regardless of their internal structure and sunspot distribution. <BR /> Aims: We studied the oscillatory dynamics of two ARs: NOAA 11327 and NOAA 11726 using two different methods of pattern recognition. <BR /> Methods: We developed a novel method of automated AR border detection and compared it to an existing method for the proof-of-concept. The first method uses least-squares fitting on the smallest ellipse enclosing the AR, while the second method applies regression on the convex hull. <BR /> Results: After processing the data, we found that the axes and the inclination angle of the ellipse and the convex hull oscillate in time. These oscillations are interpreted as the second harmonic of the standing long-period kink oscillations (with the node at the apex) of the magnetic flux tube connecting the two main sunspots of the ARs. We also found that the inclination angles oscillate with characteristic periods of 4.9 h in AR 11726 and 4.6 h in AR 11327. In addition, we discovered that the lengths of the pattern axes in the ARs oscillate with similar characteristic periods and these oscillations might be ascribed to standing global flute modes. <BR /> Conclusions: In both ARs we have estimated the distribution of the phase speed magnitude along the magnetic tubes (along the two main spots) by interpreting the obtained oscillation of the inclination angle as the standing second harmonic kink mode. After comparing the obtained results for fast and slow kink modes, we conclude that both of these modes are good candidates to explain the observed oscillations of the AR inclination angles, as in the high plasma β regime the phase speeds of these modes are comparable and on the order of the Alfvén speed. Based on the properties of the observed oscillations, we detected the appropriate depth of the sunspot patterns, which coincides with estimations made by helioseismic methods. The latter analysis can be used as a basis for developing a magneto-seismological tool for ARs.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917726","page":["A93"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..93D","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Dumbadze, G.","Shergelashvili, B.

We compared these to correlations derived for core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in the literature to connect CCSNe of different types with the initial masses of their progenitors and to test the validity of progenitor mass estimates which use the pixel statistics method. We obtained samples of evolved massive stars in both galaxies from catalogues with good spatial coverage and/or completeness, and combined them with coordinates of main-sequence stars in the LMC from the SIMBAD database. We calculated the spatial correlation of stars of different classes and spectral types with Hα emission. We also investigated the effects of distance, noise and positional errors on the pixel statistics method. A higher correlation with Hα emission is found to correspond to a shorter stellar lifespan, and we conclude that the method can be used as an indicator of the ages, and therefore initial masses, of SN progenitors. We find that the spatial distributions of type II-P SNe and red supergiants of appropriate initial mass (≳9 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) are consistent with each other. We also find the distributions of type Ic SNe and WN stars with initial masses ≳20 M<SUB>☉</SUB> consistent, while supergiants with initial masses around 15 M<SUB>☉</SUB> are a better match for type IIb and II-L SNe. The type Ib distribution corresponds to the same stellar types as type II-P, which suggests an origin in interacting binaries.

Z CMa is a complex pre-main sequence binary with a current separation of 110 mas, known to consist of an FU Orionis star (SE component) and an embedded Herbig Be star (NW component). Although it represents a well-studied and characterized system, the origin of photometric variabilities, the component properties, and the physical configuration of the system remain mostly unknown. <BR /> Aims: Immediately when the late-2008 outburst of Z CMa was announced to the community, we initiated a high angular resolution imaging campaign aimed at characterizing the outburst state of both components of the system in the near-infrared. <BR /> Methods: We used the VLT/NACO and the Keck/NIRC2 near-infrared adaptive optics instrument to monitor the astrometric position and the near-infrared photometry of the Z CMa components during the outburst phase and one year after. The VLT/SINFONI and Keck/OSIRIS integral field spectroscrographs were in addition used to characterize for the first time the resolved spectral properties of the FU Orionis and the Herbig Be component during and after the outburst. <BR /> Results: We confirm that the NW star dominates the system flux in the 1.1-3.8 μm range and is responsible for the photometric outburst. We extract the first medium-resolution (R 2000-4000) near-infrared (1.1-2.4 μm) spectra of the individual components. The SE component has a spectrum typical of FU Orionis objects. The NW component spectrum is characteristic of embedded outbursting protostars and EX Or objects. It displays numerous emission lines whose intensity correlates with the system activity. In particular, we find a correlation between the Brγ equivalent width and the system brightness. The bluing of the continuum of the NW component along with the absolute flux and color-variation of the system during the outburst suggests that the outburst was caused by a complex interplay between a variation of the extinction in the line of sight of the NW component on one hand, and the emission of shocked regions close to the NW component on the other. We confirm the recently reported wiggling of the SE component jet from [Fe II] line emission. We find a point-like structure associated with a peak emission at 2.098 μm coincidental with the clump or arm seen in broadband polarization differential imaging as well as additional diffuse emission along a PA = 214°. The origin of these two structures is unclear and deserves further investigation.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917615","page":["A91"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..91B","bibgroup":["Keck","ESO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Bonnefoy, M.","Chauvin, G.","Dougados, C.","Kóspál, Á.","Benisty, M.","Duchêne, G.","Bouvier, J.","Garcia, P.

The ρ Ophiuchi molecular complex and in particular the Lynds L1688 dark cloud is unique in its proximity ( 130 pc), in its richness in young stars and protostars, and in its youth (0.5 Myr). It is certainly one of the best targets currently accessible from the ground to study the early phases of star-formation. Proper motion analysis is a very efficient tool for separating members of clusters from field stars, but very few proper motions are available in the ρ Ophiuchi region since most of the young sources are deeply embedded in dust and gas. <BR /> Aims: We aim at performing a kinematic census of young stellar objects (YSOs) in the ρ Ophiuchi F core and partially in the E core of the L1688 dark cloud. <BR /> Methods: We run a proper motion program at the ESO New Technology Telescope (NTT) with the Son of ISAAC (SOFI) instrument over nine years in the near-infrared. We complemented these observations with various public image databases to enlarge the time base of observations and the field of investigation to 0.5° × 0.5°. We derived positions and proper motions for 2213 objects. From these, 607 proper motions were derived from SOFI observations with a 1.8 mas/yr accuracy while the remaining objects were measured only from auxiliary data with a mean precision of about 3 mas/yr. <BR /> Results: We performed a kinematic analysis of the most accurate proper motions derived in this work, which allowed us to separate cluster members from field stars and to derive the mean properties of the cluster. From the kinematic analysis we derived a list of 68 members and 14 candidate members, comprising 26 new objects with a high membership probability. These new members are generally fainter than the known ones. We measured a mean proper motion of (μ<SUB>α</SUB>cosδ, μ<SUB>δ</SUB>) = (-8.2,-24.3) ± 0.8 mas/yr for the L1688 dark cloud. A supervised classification was applied to photometric data of members to allocate a spectral energy distribution (SED) classification to the unclassified members. <BR /> Conclusions: We kinematically confirmed that the 56 members that were known from previous studies of the ρ Ophiuchi F cluster and that were also part of our survey are members of the cluster, and we added 26 new members. We defined the evolutionary status of the unclassified members of the cluster. We showed that a large part (23) of these new members are probably brown dwarfs, which multiplies the number of known substellar objects in the cluster by a factor of 3.3.

Catalogue cross-correlation is essential to building large sets of multi-wavelength data, whether it be to study the properties of populations of astrophysical objects or to build reference catalogues (or timeseries) from survey observations. Nevertheless, resorting to automated processes with limited sets of information available on large numbers of sources detected at different epochs with various filters and instruments inevitably leads to spurious associations. We need both statistical criteria to select detections to be merged as unique sources, and statistical indicators helping in achieving compromises between completeness and reliability of selected associations. <BR /> Aims: We lay the foundations of a statistical framework for multi-catalogue cross-correlation and cross-identification based on explicit simplified catalogue models. A proper identification process should rely on both astrometric and photometric data. Under some conditions, the astrometric part and the photometric part can be processed separately and merged a posteriori to provide a single global probability of identification. The present paper addresses almost exclusively the astrometrical part and specifies the proper probabilities to be merged with photometric likelihoods. <BR /> Methods: To select matching candidates in n catalogues, we used the Chi (or, indifferently, the Chi-square) test with 2(n-1) degrees of freedom. We thus call this cross-match a χ-match. In order to use Bayes' formula, we considered exhaustive sets of hypotheses based on combinatorial analysis. The volume of the χ-test domain of acceptance - a 2(n-1)-dimensional acceptance ellipsoid - is used to estimate the expected numbers of spurious associations. We derived priors for those numbers using a frequentist approach relying on simple geometrical considerations. Likelihoods are based on standard Rayleigh, χ and Poisson distributions that we normalized over the χ-test acceptance domain. We validated our theoretical results by generating and cross-matching synthetic catalogues. <BR /> Results: The results we obtain do not depend on the order used to cross-correlate the catalogues. We applied the formalism described in the present paper to build the multi-wavelength catalogues used for the science cases of the Astronomical Resource Cross-matching for High Energy Studies (ARCHES) project. Our cross-matching engine is publicly available through a multi-purpose web interface. In a longer term, we plan to integrate this tool into the CDS XMatch Service.","read_count":51,"citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917728","page":["A89"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..89P","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Pineau, F. -X.","Derriere, S.","Motch, C.","Carrera, F.

Here we analyse the evolution of the mean IGM transmission Tr(Lyα) and its dispersion along the line of sight for 2127 galaxies with 2.5 < z < 5.5 in the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We fitted model spectra combined with a range of IGM transmission to the galaxy spectra using the spectral fitting algorithm GOSSIP+. We used these fits to derive the mean IGM transmission towards each galaxy for several redshift slices from z = 2.5 to z = 5.5. We found that the mean IGM transmission defined as Tr(Lyα) = e<SUP>- τ</SUP> (with τ as the HI optical depth) is 79%, 69%, 59%, 55%, and 46% at redshifts 2.75, 3.22, 3.70, 4.23, and 4.77, respectively. We compared these results to measurements obtained from quasar lines of sight and found that the IGM transmission towards galaxies is in excellent agreement with quasar values up to redshift z 4. We found tentative evidence for a higher IGM transmission at z ≥ 4 compared to results from QSOs, but a degeneracy between dust extinction and IGM prevents us from firmly concluding whether the internal dust extinction for star-forming galaxies at z > 4 takes a mean value significantly in excess of E(B-V) > 0.15. Most importantly, we found a large dispersion of IGM transmission along the lines of sight towards distant galaxies with 68% of the distribution within 10 to 17% of the median value in δz = 0.5 bins, similar to what is found on the lines of sight towards QSOs. We demonstrate that taking this broad range of IGM transmission into account is important when selecting high-redshift galaxies based on their colour properties (e.g. LBG or photometric redshiftselection) because failing to do so causes a significant incompleteness in selecting high-redshift galaxy populations. We finally discuss the observed IGM properties and speculate that the broad range of observed transmissions might be the result of cosmic variance and clustering along lines of sight. This clearly shows that the sources that cause this extinction need to be more completely modelled.

The nature versus nurture scenario in galaxy and group evolution is a long-standing problem not yet fully understood on cosmological scales. <BR /> Aims: We study the properties of groups and their central galaxies in different large-scale environments defined by the luminosity density field and the cosmic web filaments. <BR /> Methods: We use the luminosity density field constructed using 8 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc smoothing to characterize the large-scale environments. We use the Bisous model to extract the filamentary structures in different large-scale environments. We study the properties of galaxy groups as a function of their dynamical mass in different large-scale environments. <BR /> Results: We find differences in the properties of central galaxies and their groups in and outside of filaments at fixed halo and large-scale environments. In high-density environments, the group mass function has higher number densities in filaments compared to that outside of filaments towards the massive end. The relation is the opposite in low-density environments. At fixed group mass and large-scale luminosity density, mass-to-light ratios show that groups in filaments are slightly more luminous than those outside of filaments. At fixed group mass and large-scale luminosity density, central galaxies in filaments have redder colors, higher stellar masses, and lower specific star formation rates than those outside of filaments. However, the differences in central galaxy and group properties in and outside of filaments are not clear in some group mass bins. We show that the differences in central galaxy properties are due to the higher abundances of elliptical galaxies in filaments. <BR /> Conclusions: Filamentary structures in the cosmic web are not simply visual associations of galaxies, but rather play an important role in shaping the properties of groups and their central galaxies. The differences in central galaxy and group properties in and outside of cosmic web filaments are not simple effects related to large-scale environmental density. The results point towards an efficient mechanism in cosmic web filaments which quench star formation and transform central galaxy morphology from late to early types.","read_count":50,"citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917652","page":["A86"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..86P","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Poudel, A.","Heinämäki, P.","Tempel, E.","Einasto, M.","Lietzen, H.","Nurmi, P."],"aff":["Tuorla Observatory, University of Turku, Väisäläntie 20, 21500, Piikkiö, Finland","Tuorla Observatory, University of Turku, Väisäläntie 20, 21500, Piikkiö, Finland","Tartu Observatory, Observatooriumi 1, 61602, Tõravere, Estonia; Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP), An der Sternwarte 16, 14482, Potsdam, Germany","Tartu Observatory, Observatooriumi 1, 61602, Tõravere, Estonia","Tuorla Observatory, University of Turku, Väisäläntie 20, 21500, Piikkiö, Finland","Tuorla Observatory, University of Turku, Väisäläntie 20, 21500, Piikkiö, Finland; Finnish Centre for Astronomy with ESO (FINCA), University of Turku, Väisäläntie 20, 21500, Piikkiö, Finland"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-"],"orcid_other":["-","-","0000-0002-5249-7018","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629639"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["galaxies: groups: general","galaxies: star formation","galaxies: stellar content","galaxies: structure","cosmology: observations","large-scale structure of Universe","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the anonymous referee for constructive comments that improved the quality of the paper.

We compare the centroids of the different velocity components to expectations based on orbital dynamics in the presence of bar and spiral potential perturbations. A model of the region as the interface of two gas-populated orbits families supporting the bar and the independently rotating spiral arms provides an overall good match to the data. An extent of the bar to the corotation radius of the galaxy is favored. <BR /> Conclusions: Using NGC 3627 as an extragalactic example, we expect situations like this to favor strong star formation events such as are observed in our own Milky Way since gas can pile up where the orbit families cross. The relative motions of the material following these orbits is most likely even more important for the build-up of high density in the region. The surface densities in NGC 3627 are also so high that shear at the bar end is unlikely to significantly weaken the star formation activity. We speculate that scenarios in which the bar and spiral rotate at two different pattern speeds may be the most favorable for intense star formation at such interfaces.

The study of the radial variations of metallicity across the Galactic disc is a powerful method for understanding the history of star formation and chemical evolution of the Milky Way. Although several studies about gradients have been performed so far, the knowledge of the Galactic antincentre is still poor. <BR /> Aims: This work aims to determine accurately the physical and chemical properties of a sample of H II regions located at R<SUB>G</SUB> > 11 kpc and to study the radial distribution of abundances in the outermost part of the Galaxy disc. <BR /> Methods: We carried out new optical spectroscopic observations of nine H II regions with the William Herschel Telescope covering the spectral range from 3500 Å to 10 100 Å. In addition, we increased the sample by searching the literature for optical observations of regions towards the Galactic anticentre, re-analysing them to obtain a single sample of 23 objects to be processed in a homogeneous and consistent manner. The total sample distribution covers the Galactocentric radius from 11 kpc to 18 kpc. <BR /> Results: Emission line ratios were used to determine accurate electron densities and temperatures of several ionic species in 13 H II regions. These physical parameters were applied to the spectra to determine direct total chemical abundances. For those regions without direct estimations of temperature, chemical abundances were derived by performing tailor-made photoionisation models and/or by using an empirical relation obtained from radio recombination and optical temperatures. We performed weighted least-squares fits to the distribution of the derived abundances along the Galactocentric distances to study the radial gradients of metallicity across the outermost part of the MW. The distributions O/H, N/H, S/H, and Ar/H towards the anticentre can be represented by decreasing linear radial gradients, while in the case of N/O abundances the radial distribution is better fitted with a two-zone model. The He/H radial gradient is presented here for the first time; we find a slope that is not significantly different from zero. The derived gradient for oxygen shows a clear decrease with distance with a slope of -0.053 ± 0.009 dex kpc<SUP>-1</SUP>. Although a shallower slope at large Galactocentric distances is suggested by our data, the flattening of the distribution cannot be confirmed and more objects towards the anticentre need to be studied in order to establish the true form of the metallicity gradient.","read_count":30,"citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917627","page":["A84"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..84F","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Fernández-Martín, A.","Pérez-Montero, E.","Vílchez, J.

The International Astronomical Union (IAU) adopted a new precession model at its 2006 General Assembly. After more than ten years since the publication of the so-called IAU 2006 precession, we have noticed progress in solar system ephemerides and geophysical observations, which can be used to refine the precession model. Another progress is the increase by 30% since 2003, of the length of the very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations to be compared with the theoretical model. <BR /> Aims: The aim of this paper is to investigate the possibility of upgrading the IAU 2006 precession model based on new solutions of the Earth-Moon barycenter (EMB) motion, new theoretical contributions to the precession rates, and the revised J<SUB>2</SUB> long-term variation obtained from the satellite laser ranging (SLR). <BR /> Methods: The new precession expressions for the ecliptic are derived by fitting the new analytical planetary theory VSOP2013 to the numerical ephemerides DE422 or INPOP10a. The solution for the precession of the equator was obtained by integrating the dynamical precession equations with the use of an updated Earth model including the J<SUB>2</SUB> quadratic long-term variation. The new precession expressions (denoted LC solution in this paper) are compared with the IAU 2006 model by using the most accurate VLBI observations up to 2015. <BR /> Results: For the precession of the ecliptic, the changes in the new solutions with respect to the IAU 2006 are about several tens of microarcseconds in the linear terms of P<SUB>A</SUB> and Q<SUB>A</SUB>. The upgraded precession of the equator is such that the quadratic and cubic terms in the quantity ψ<SUB>A</SUB> differ significantly from IAU 2006 due to the revised J<SUB>2</SUB> model. The statistics of the VLBI celestial pole offsets (1979-2015) and least squares fits with different empirical models, show that the LC precession is slightly more consistent with the VLBI observations, but the improvement relative to the IAU 2006 model is not definitely convincing at present. <BR /> Conclusions: The upgraded LC precession obtained with the latest theoretical and observational improvements has shown some advantages with respect to the IAU 2006 model. However, due to negligible changes in the precession of the ecliptic and large uncertainties in the J<SUB>2</SUB> variation, we recommend that the standard IAU 2006 model be retained for practical use and continuity reason. The next precession-nutation model should be constructed with a uniform dynamical approach in the framework of ICRF3 and Gaia reference frame and without the use of a conventional ecliptic.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14917716","page":["A83"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..83L","identifier":["2017A&A...597A..83L","10.1051/0004-6361/201628717","10.1051/0004-6361/201628717"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Liu, J. -C.","Capitaine, N."],"aff":["School of Astronomy and Space Science, Key Laboratory of Modern Astronomy and Astrophysics (Ministry of Education), Nanjing University, 163 XianLin Avenue, 210023, Nanjing, PR China","SYRTE, Observatoire de Paris, PSL Research University, CNRS, Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ.

We use a high-resolution spectrum obtained with the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph together with a deep multi-wavelength medium-resolution spectrum obtained with X-shooter (both on the Very Large Telescope) to perform a detailed analysis of the absorption lines from ionic, neutral atomic and molecular species in different excitation levels, as well as the broad-band dust extinction. We find that the absorber classifies as a Damped Lyman-α system (DLA) with log N(H I) (cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) = 20.8 ± 0.1. The DLA has super-solar metallicity (Z 2.5 Z<SUB>☉</SUB>, albeit to within a factor of two to three) with a depletion pattern typical of cold gas and an overall molecular fraction f = 2N(H<SUB>2</SUB>)/(2N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) + N(H I)) 50%. This is the highest f-value observed to date in a high-z intervening system. Most of the molecular hydrogen arises from a clearly identified narrow (b 0.7km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), cold component in which carbon monoxide molecules are also found, with log N(CO)≈ 15. With the help of the spectral synthesis code Cloudy, we study the chemical and physical conditions in the cold gas. We find that the line of sight probes the gas deep after the H I-to-H<SUB>2</SUB> transition in a 4-5 pc-size cloud with volumic density n<SUB>H</SUB> 80 cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and temperature of only 50 K. Our model suggests that the presence of small dust grains (down to about 0.001 μm) and high cosmic ray ionisation rate (ζ<SUB>H</SUB> a few times 10<SUP>-15</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>) are needed to explain the observed atomic and molecular abundances. The presence of small grains is also in agreement with the observed steep extinction curve that also features a 2175 Å bump. Interestingly, the chemical and physical properties of this cloud are very similar to what is seen in diffuse molecular regions of the nearby Perseus complex, despite the former being observed when the Universe was only 2.5 Gyr old. The high excitation temperature of CO rotational levels towards J0000+0048 betrays however the higher temperature of the cosmic microwave background.

In the coupled corona, transition region, and chromosphere system, an enhanced downward conductive flux results in an upflow (chromospheric evaporation). However, obtaining the correct upflow generally requires high spatial resolution in order to resolve the transition region. With an unresolved transition region, artificially low coronal densities are obtained because the downward heat flux \"jumps\" across the unresolved region to the chromosphere, underestimating the upflows. Here, we treat the lower transition region as a discontinuity that responds to changing coronal conditions through the imposition of a jump condition that is derived from an integrated form of energy conservation. To illustrate and benchmark this approach against a fully resolved one-dimensional model, we present field-aligned simulations of coronal loops in response to a range of impulsive (spatially uniform) heating events. We show that our approach leads to a significant improvement in the coronal density evolution than just when using coarse spatial resolutions insufficient to resolve the lower transition region. Our approach compensates for the jumping of the heat flux by imposing a velocity correction that ensures that the energy from the heat flux goes into driving the transition region dynamics, rather than being lost through radiation. Hence, it is possible to obtain improved coronal densities. The advantages of using this approach in both one-dimensional hydrodynamic and three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations are discussed.","read_count":24,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917701","page":["A81"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..81J","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Johnston, C.

The γ-ray BL Lac object OJ 287 is known to exhibit inner-parsec \"jet-wobbling\", high degrees of variability at all wavelengths and quasi-stationary features, including an apparent (≈100°) position-angle change in projection on the sky plane. <BR /> Aims: Sub-50 micro-arcsecond resolution 86 GHz observations with the global mm-VLBI array (GMVA) supplement ongoing multi-frequency VLBI blazar monitoring at lower frequencies. Using these maps, together with cm/mm total intensity and γ-ray observations from Fermi-LAT from 2008-2014, we aim to determine the location of γ-ray emission and to explain the inner-mas structural changes. <BR /> Methods: Observations with the GMVA offer approximately double the angular resolution compared with 43 GHz VLBA observations and enable us to observe above the synchrotron self-absorption peak frequency. Fermi-LAT γ-ray data were reduced and analysed. The jet was spectrally decomposed at multiple locations along the jet. From this, we could derive estimates of the magnetic field using equipartition and synchrotron self-absorption arguments. How the field decreases down the jet provided an estimate of the distance to the jet apex and an estimate of the magnetic field strength at the jet apex and in the broad line region. Combined with accurate kinematics, we attempt to locate the site of γ-ray activity, radio flares, and spectral changes. <BR /> Results: Strong γ-ray flares appeared to originate from either the so-called core region, a downstream stationary feature, or both, with γ-ray activity significantly correlated with radio flaring in the downstream quasi-stationary feature. Magnetic field estimates were determined at multiple locations along the jet, with the magnetic field found to be ≥1.6 G in the core and ≤0.4 G in the downstream quasi-stationary feature. We therefore found upper limits on the location of the VLBI core as ≲6.0 pc from the jet apex and determined an upper limit on the magnetic field near the jet base of the order of thousands of Gauss.

In this study, we took advantage of the two short series of observations in the He II 304 Å line obtained by the TESIS solar observatory with a cadence of up to 3.5 s to study the dynamics of macrospicules in unprecedented detail. We used a one-dimensional hydrodynamic method based on the assumption of their axial symmetry and on a simple radiative transfer model to reconstruct the evolution of the internal velocity field of 18 macrospicules from this dataset. Besides the internal dynamics, we studied the motion of the apparent end points of the same 18 macrospicules and found 15 of them to follow parabolic trajectories with high precision which correspond closely to the obtained velocity fields. We found that in a clear, unperturbed case these macrospicules move with a constant deceleration inconsistent with a purely ballistic motion and have roughly the same velocity along their entire axis, with the obtained decelerations typically ranging from 160 to 230 m s<SUP>-2</SUP>, and initial velocities from 80 to 130 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We also found a propagating acoustic wave for one of the macrospicules and a clear linear correlation between the initial velocities of the macrospicules and their decelerations, which indicates that they may be driven by magneto-acoustic shocks. Finally, we inverted our previous method by taking velocities from the parabolic fits to give rough estimates of the percentage of mass lost by 12 of the macrospicules. We found that typically from 10 to 30% of their observed mass fades out of the line (presumably being heated to higher coronal temperatures) with three exceptions of 50% and one of 80%.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917649","page":["A78"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..78L","bibgroup":["Solar Dynamics Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Loboda, I.

The link between both emissions has been investigated in many previous studies, but no statistical studies have compared both coronal and interplanetary type III bursts with X-ray flares. <BR /> Aims: Using events where the coronal radio emission above 100 MHz is exclusively from type III bursts, we revisited some long-standing questions regarding the relation between type III bursts and X-ray flares: Do all coronal type III bursts have X-ray counterparts? What correlation, if any, occurs between radio and X-ray intensities? What X-ray and radio signatures above 100 MHz occur in connection with interplanetary type III bursts below 14 MHz? <BR /> Methods: We analysed ten years of data from 2002 to 2011 starting with a selection of coronal type III bursts above 100 MHz. We used X-ray flare information from RHESSI >6 keV to make a list of 321 events that have associated type III bursts and X-ray flares, encompassing at least 28% of the initial sample of type III events. We then examined the timings, intensities, associated GOES class, and whether there was an associated interplanetary radio signature in both radio and X-rays. <BR /> Results: For our 321 events with radio and X-ray signatures, the X-ray emission at 6 keV usually lasted much longer than the groups of type III bursts at frequencies >100 MHz. The selected events were mostly associated with GOES B and C class flares. A weak correlation was found between the type III radio flux at frequencies below 327 MHz and the X-ray intensity at 25-50 keV, with an absence of events at high X-ray intensity and low type III radio flux. The weakness of the correlation is related to the coherent emission mechanism of radio type IIIs which can produce high radio fluxes by low density electron beams. Interplanetary type III bursts (<4 MHz) were observed for 54% of the events. The percentage of association increased when events were observed with 25-50 keV X-rays. A stronger interplanetary association was present when 25-50 keV RHESSI count rates were above 250 counts/s or radio fluxes of around 170 MHz were large (>10<SUP>3</SUP> SFU), relating to electron beams with more energetic electrons above 25 keV and events where magnetic flux tubes extend into the high corona. We also find that whilst on average type III bursts increase in flux with decreasing frequency, the rate of this increase varies from event to event.","read_count":39,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917722","page":["A77"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..77R","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Reid, Hamish A.

A follow-up XMM-Newton observation revealed the X-ray counterpart of the pulsar and a slightly asymmetric pulsar wind nebula, which suggests possible jet structures. Lying at a distance d ≤ 900 pc, PSR J0855-4644 is a pulsar with one of the highest Ė/d<SUP>2</SUP> from which no GeV γ-ray pulsations have been detected. With a dedicated Chandra observation we aim to further resolve the possible jet structures of the nebula and study the pulsar geometry to understand the lack of γ-ray pulsations. <BR /> Methods: We performed detailed spatial modelling to constrain the geometry of the pulsar wind nebula and in particular the pulsar line of sight (observer angle) ζ<SUB>PSR</SUB>, which is defined as the angle between the direction of the observer and the pulsar spin axis. We also performed geometric radio and γ-ray light-curve modelling using a hollow-cone radio beam model together with two-pole caustic and outer gap models to further constrain ζ<SUB>PSR</SUB> and the magnetic obliquity α defined as the angle between the magnetic and spin axes of the pulsar. <BR /> Results: The Chandra observation reveals that the compact XMM source, thought to be the X-ray pulsar, can be further resolved into a point source surrounded by an elongated axisymmetric nebula with a longitudinal extent of 10''. The pulsar flux represents only 1% of the XMM compact source, and its spectrum is well described by a blackbody of temperature kT = 0.2 keV, while the surrounding nebula has a much harder spectrum (Γ = 1.1 for a power-law model). Assuming the origin of the extended emission is a double torus yields ζ<SUB>PSR</SUB> = 32.5° ± 4.3°. The detection of thermal X-rays from the pulsar may point to a low value of | ζ-α | if this emission originates from a heated polar cap. Independent constraints from geometric light-curve modelling yield α ≲ 55° and ζ ≲ 55°, and 10° ≲ | ζ-α | ≲ 30°. A χ<SUP>2</SUP> fit to the radio light curve yields a best fit at (α,ζ<SUB>PSR</SUB>) = (22°,8°), with an alternative fit at (α,ζ<SUB>PSR</SUB>) = (9°,25°) within 3σ. The lack of non-thermal X-ray emission from the pulsar further supports low values for α and ζ under the assumption that X-rays and γ-rays are generated in the same region of the pulsar magnetosphere. Such a geometry would explain, in the standard caustic pulsar model picture, the radio-loud and γ-ray-quiet behaviour of this high Ė/d<SUP>2</SUP> pulsar.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917702","page":["A75"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..75M","bibgroup":["CXC"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Maitra, C.","Acero, F.","Venter, C."],"aff":["Laboratoire AIM, IRFU/Service d'Astrophysique - CEA/DRF - CNRS - Université Paris Diderot, Bât. 709, CEA-Saclay, 91191, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France","Laboratoire AIM, IRFU/Service d'Astrophysique - CEA/DRF - CNRS - Université Paris Diderot, Bât. 709, CEA-Saclay, 91191, Gif-sur-Yvette Cedex, France","Centre for Space Research, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, Private Bag X6001, 2520, Potchefstroom, South Africa"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"orcid_other":["-","-","0000-0002-2666-4812"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201628998"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["CXO:1","HEASARC:1","SIMBAD:5"],"keyword":["acceleration of particles","pulsars: individual: PSR J0855-4644","X-rays: general","methods: miscellaneous","Astrophysics - High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe gratefully acknowledge fruitful discussions with Alice Harding.

For most of the molecules detected (HCN, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH, CS, SO, <SUP>13</SUP>CO and C<SUP>18</SUP>O), abundances are best fit with three values, presenting a clear decrease of abundance of at least one or two orders of magnitude towards the center of the core. The Bonnor-Ebert analysis indicates the core is gravitationally unstable and the magnetic field is not strong enough to avoid the collapse. Depletion of molecules onto the dust grains occurs at the interior of the core, where dust grain growth and dust depolarization also occurs. This suggests that these properties may be related. On the other hand, some molecules exhibit asymmetries in their integrated emission maps, which appear to be correlated with a previously reported submillimetre polarization asymmetry. These asymmetries could be due to a stronger interstellar radiation field in the western side of the core.

The projection factor p is the key quantity used in the Baade-Wesselink (BW) method for distance determination; it converts radial velocities into pulsation velocities. Several methods are used to determine p, such as geometrical and hydrodynamical models or the inverse BW approach when the distance is known. <BR /> Aims: We analyze new HARPS-N spectra of δ Cep to measure its cycle-averaged atmospheric velocity gradient in order to better constrain the projection factor. <BR /> Methods: We first apply the inverse BW method to derive p directly from observations. The projection factor can be divided into three subconcepts: (1) a geometrical effect (p<SUB>0</SUB>); (2) the velocity gradient within the atmosphere (f<SUB>grad</SUB>); and (3) the relative motion of the optical pulsating photosphere with respect to the corresponding mass elements (f<SUB>o-g</SUB>). We then measure the f<SUB>grad</SUB> value of δ Cep for the first time. <BR /> Results: When the HARPS-N mean cross-correlated line-profiles are fitted with a Gaussian profile, the projection factor is p<SUB>cc-g</SUB> = 1.239 ± 0.034(stat.) ± 0.023(syst.). When we consider the different amplitudes of the radial velocity curves that are associated with 17 selected spectral lines, we measure projection factors ranging from 1.273 to 1.329. We find a relation between f<SUB>grad</SUB> and the line depth measured when the Cepheid is at minimum radius. This relation is consistent with that obtained from our best hydrodynamical model of δ Cep and with our projection factor decomposition. Using the observational values of p and f<SUB>grad</SUB> found for the 17 spectral lines, we derive a semi-theoretical value of f<SUB>o-g</SUB>. We alternatively obtain f<SUB>o-g</SUB> = 0.975 ± 0.002 or 1.006 ± 0.002 assuming models using radiative transfer in plane-parallel or spherically symmetric geometries, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: The new HARPS-N observations of δ Cep are consistent with our decomposition of the projection factor. The next step will be to measure p<SUB>0</SUB> directly from the next generation of visible interferometers. With these values in hand, it will be possible to derive f<SUB>o-g</SUB> directly from observations.

Mid-IR water lines from protoplanetary disks around T Tauri stars have a detection rate of 50%. Models have identified multiple physical properties of disks such as dust-to-gas mass ratio, dust size power law distribution, disk gas mass, disk inner radius, and disk scale height as potential explanations for the current detection rate. <BR /> Aims: In this study, we aim to break degeneracies through constraints obtained from observations. We search for a connection between mid-IR water line fluxes and the strength of the 10 μm silicate feature. <BR /> Methods: We analyze observed water line fluxes from three blends at 15.17, 17.22 and 29.85 μm published earlier and compute the 10 μm silicate feature strength from Spitzer spectra to search for possible trends. We use a series of published ProDiMo thermo-chemical models, to explore disk dust and gas properties, and also the effects of different central stars. In addition, we produced two standard models with different dust opacity functions, and one with a parametric prescription for the dust settling. <BR /> Results: Our series of models that vary properties of the grain size distribution suggest that mid-IR water emission anticorrelates with the strength of the 10 μm silicate feature. The models also show that the increasing stellar bolometric luminosity simultaneously enhance the strength of this dust feature and the water lines fluxes. No correlation is found between the observed mid-IR water lines and the 10 μm silicate strength. Two-thirds of the targets in our sample show crystalline dust features, and the disks are mainly flaring. Our sample shows the same difference in the peak strength between amorphous and crystalline silicates that was noted in earlier studies, but our models do not support this intrinsic difference in silicate peak strength. Individual properties of our models are not able to reproduce the most extreme observations, suggesting that more complex dust properties (e.g., vertically changing) are required to reproduce the strongest 10 μm silicate features. A parametrized settling prescription is able to boost the peak strength by a factor of 2 for the standard model. Water line fluxes are unrelated to the composition of the dust. The pronounced regular trends seen in the model results are washed out in the data due to the larger diversity in stellar and disk properties compared to our series of model. <BR /> Conclusions: The independent nature of the water line emission and the 10 μm silicate strength found in observations, and the modeling results, leave as a possible explanation that the disks with weaker mid-IR water line fluxes are depleted in gas or enhanced in dust in the inner 10 au. In the case of gas depleted disks, settling produces very strong 10 μm silicate features with strong peak strength. Observations of larger unbiased samples with JWST/MIRI and ALMA are essential to verify this hypothesis.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917634","page":["A72"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..72A","bibgroup":["Leiden Observatory","Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Antonellini, S.","Bremer, J.","Kamp, I.","Riviere-Marichalar, P.","Lahuis, F.","Thi, W. -F.","Woitke, P.","Meijerink, R.","Aresu, G.","Spaans, M."],"aff":["Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, Postbus 800, 9700 AV, Groningen, The Netherlands","Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, Postbus 800, 9700 AV, Groningen, The Netherlands","Kapteyn Astronomical Institute, Postbus 800, 9700 AV, Groningen, The Netherlands","Centro de Astrobiología (INTA-CSIC) - Depto.

Recently it has been found that models of massive stars reach the Eddington limit in their interior, which leads to dilute extended envelopes. <BR /> Aims: We perform a comparative study of the envelope properties of massive stars at different metallicities, with the aim to establish the impact of the stellar metallicity on the effect of envelope inflation. <BR /> Methods: We analysed published grids of core-hydrogen burning massive star models computed with metallicities appropriate for massive stars in the Milky Way, the Large Magellanic Cloud, and the Small Magellanic Cloud, the very metal poor dwarf galaxy I Zwicky 18, and for metal-free chemical composition. <BR /> Results: Stellar models of all the investigated metallicities reach and exceed the Eddington limit in their interior, aided by the opacity peaks of iron, helium, and hydrogen, and consequently develop inflated envelopes. Envelope inflation leads to a redward bending of the zero-age main sequence and a broadening of the main-sequence band in the upper part of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. We derive the limiting L/M-values as a function of the stellar surface temperature above which inflation occurs, and find them to be higher for lower metallicity.

Gravitational collapse of molecular cloud or cloud core/clump may lead to the formation of geometrically flattened, rotating accretion flow surrounding the new born star or star cluster. Gravitational instability may occur in such accretion flow when the gas to stellar mass ratio is high (e.g., over 10%). <BR /> Aims: This paper takes the OB cluster-forming region G10.6-0.4 as an example. We introduce the enclosed gas mass around its central ultra compact (UC) Hii region, address the gravitational stability of the accreting gas, and outline the observed potential signatures of gravitational instability. <BR /> Methods: The dense gas accretion flow around the central UC Hii region in G10.6-0.4 is geometrically flattened, and is in an approximately edge-on projection. The position-velocity (PV) diagrams of various molecular gas tracers on G10.6-0.4 consistently show asymmetry in the spatial- and the velocity domain. We deduce the morphology of the dense gas accretion flow by modeling velocity distribution of the azimuthally asymmetric gas structures, and by directly de-projecting the PV diagrams. <BR /> Results: We find that within the 0.3 pc radius, an infall velocity of 1-2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> may be required to explain the observed PV diagrams. In addition, the velocity distribution traced in the PV diagrams can be interpreted by spiral arm-like structures, which may be connected with exterior infalling gas filaments. We propose that the morphology of dense gas structures appears very similar to the spatially resolved gas structures around the OB cluster-forming region G33.92+0.11 with similar gas mass and size, which is likely, however, to be in an approximately face-on projection. <BR /> Conclusions: The dense gas accretion flow around G10.6-0.4 appears to be Toomre-unstable, which is consistent with the existence of large-scale spiral arm-like structures, and the formation of localized gas condensations. The proposed approaches for data analyses may be applied to the observations of Class 0/I low-mass protostars, in diagnosis of disk gravitational instability.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917638","page":["A70"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..70L","bibgroup":["SMA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Liu, Hauyu Baobab"],"aff":["European Southern Observatory (ESO), Karl-Schwarzschild-Str. 2, 85748, Garching, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629582"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["stars: formation","ISM: jets and outflows","ISM: structure","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\n The Submillimeter Array is a joint project between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics, and is funded by the Smithsonian Institution and the Academia Sinica (Ho et al. 2004).

However, it remains unclear how the initial mass function of these planetesimals depends on the box dimensions of numerical simulations. To resolve this, we perform simulations of planetesimal formation with the largest box dimensions to date, allowing planetesimals to form simultaneously in multiple filaments that can only emerge within such large simulation boxes. In our simulations, planetesimals with sizes between 80 km and several hundred kilometers form. We find that a power law with a rather shallow exponential cutoff at the high-mass end represents the cumulative birth mass function better than an integrated power law. The steepness of the exponential cutoff is largely independent of box dimensions and resolution, while the exponent of the power law is not constrained at the resolutions we employ. Moreover, we find that the characteristic mass scale of the exponential cutoff correlates with the mass budget in each filament. Together with previous studies of high-resolution simulations with small box domains, our results therefore imply that the cumulative birth mass function of planetesimals is consistent with an exponentially tapered power law with a power-law exponent of approximately -1.6 and a steepness of the exponential cutoff in the range of 0.3-0.4.","read_count":50,"citation_count":12,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917694","page":["A69"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..69S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Schäfer, Urs","Yang, Chao-Chin","Johansen, Anders"],"aff":["Hamburg Observatory, University of Hamburg, Gojenbergsweg 112, 21029, Hamburg, Germany ; Lund Observatory, Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics, Lund University, PO Box 43, 22100, Lund, Sweden","Lund Observatory, Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics, Lund University, PO Box 43, 22100, Lund, Sweden","Lund Observatory, Department of Astronomy and Theoretical Physics, Lund University, PO Box 43, 22100, Lund, Sweden"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629561"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["hydrodynamics","instabilities","methods: numerical","planets and satellites: formation","protoplanetary disks","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank Piero Ranalli for his advice on how to calculate the standard errors of the fitting parameters.

A complete set of orbital parameters for barium stars, including the longest orbits, has recently been obtained thanks to a radial-velocity monitoring with the HERMES spectrograph installed on the Flemish Mercator telescope. Barium stars are supposed to belong to post-mass-transfer systems. <BR /> Aims: In order to identify diagnostics distinguishing between pre- and post-mass-transfer systems, the properties of barium stars (more precisely their mass-function distribution and their period-eccentricity (P-e) diagram) are compared to those of binary red giants in open clusters. As a side product, we aim to identify possible post-mass-transfer systems among the cluster giants from the presence of s-process overabundances. We investigate the relation between the s-process enrichment, the location in the (P-e) diagram, and the cluster metallicity and turn-off mass. <BR /> Methods: To invert the mass-function distribution and derive the mass-ratio distribution, we used the method pioneered by Boffin et al. (1992) that relies on a Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm. The derivation of s-process abundances in the open-cluster giants was performed through spectral synthesis with MARCS model atmospheres. <BR /> Results: A fraction of 22% of post-mass-transfer systems is found among the cluster binary giants (with companion masses between 0.58 and 0.87 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, typical for white dwarfs), and these systems occupy a wider area than barium stars in the (P-e) diagram. Barium stars have on average lower eccentricities at a given orbital period. When the sample of binary giant stars in clusters is restricted to the subsample of systems occupying the same locus as the barium stars in the (P-e) diagram, and with a mass function compatible with a WD companion, 33% (=4/12) show a chemical signature of mass transfer in the form of s-process overabundances (from rather moderate - about 0.3 dex - to more extreme - about 1 dex). The only strong barium star in our sample is found in the cluster with the lowest metallicity in the sample (I.e. star 173 in NGC 2420, with [Fe/H] = -0.26), whereas the barium stars with mild s-process abundance anomalies (from 0.25 to 0.6 dex) are found in the clusters with slightly subsolar metallicities. Our finding confirms the classical prediction that the s-process nucleosynthesis is more efficient at low metallicities, since the s-process overabundance is not clearly correlated with the cluster turn-off (TO) mass; such a correlation would instead hint at the importance of the dilution factor. We also find a mild barium star in NGC 2335, a cluster with a large TO mass of 4.3 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, which implies that asymptotic giant branch stars that massive still operate the s-process and the third dredge-up.

The feedback of star formation to the parent cloud is conventionally examined through the study of molecular outflows. Little is known, however, about the effect that atomic ejecta tracing fast shocks can have on small scales or on global cloud properties. <BR /> Aims: Our immediate objective is to study the morphology of protostellar ejecta through far-infrared atomic lines, compare them to other outflow tracers, and associate them with their driving sources. The main goal is to study the feedback from atomic jet emission that is excited by fast shocks on the parent cloud material, and examine the relative importance of atomic jets as regulators of the star formation process. <BR /> Methods: We employed [O I] and [C II] line maps of the NGC 1333 star-forming region observed with Herschel/PACS. We studied the detailed morphology and velocity distribution of the [O I] line using channel and line-centroid maps. We derived the momentum, energy, and mass flux for all the bipolar outflows traced by [O I] line emission. We compared the [O I] morphology to CO and H<SUB>2</SUB> emission, and its dynamical and kinematic properties to the emission corresponding to CO outflows. <BR /> Results: We find that the line-centroid maps can trace velocity structures down to 5 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> which is a factor of 20 beyond the nominal velocity resolution reached by Herschel/PACS. These maps reveal an unprecedented degree of details that significantly assist in the association and characterization of outflows. We associate most of the [O I] emission with ejecta from embedded protostars. The spatial distribution of the [O I] emission closely follows the CO emission pattern and strongly correlates to the spatial distribution of the H<SUB>2</SUB> emission, with the latter indicating excitation in shocks. The [O I] momentum accounts for only 1% of the momentum carried by the large-scale CO outflows. The energy released in shocks, however, corresponds to 50-100% of the energy carried away by outflows. Mass-flux estimates of the atomic gas range between 10<SUP>-6</SUP> and 10<SUP>-7</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB> km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, which is in line with previous estimations. <BR /> Conclusions: The detailed study of line-centroid shifts in maps introduced for the first time in this study can provide an invaluable tool for the study of outflows. Assuming that the [O I] corresponds to an atomic jet that also drives the CO outflow, we find that the mass traced by [O I] corresponds to a small fraction compared to the mass corresponding to the CO outflows. This may indicate that only a small fraction of the mass of atomic jets is excited in shocks, which is consistent with the sizes of the shock-cooling zones compared to the total jet length. The estimated ratios of the jet to the outflow momenta and energies are also consistent with the results of two-component, nested jet and outflow simulations, where jets are associated with episodic accretion events. The mass flux from the [O I] calculated here and in other studies shows no clear evolutionary pattern with the age of the parent source, which is in support of the scenario that jets are associated with episodic accretion events. The energy contribution of the jet-induced shocks to the cloud, is important and can equal the energy deposited by outflows. We therefore conclude that the atomic component, either ejected or formed in shocks plays an important role in generating and maintaining turbulence in clouds but also in dissipating the cloud gas.","citation_count":3,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917617","page":["A64"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..64D","bibgroup":["Herschel","Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Dionatos, Odysseas","Güdel, Manuel"],"aff":["University of Vienna, Department of Astrophysics, Türkenschanzstrasse 17, 1180, Vienna, Austria","University of Vienna, Department of Astrophysics, Türkenschanzstrasse 17, 1180, Vienna, Austria"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629179"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["Herschel:1","SIMBAD:23"],"keyword":["stars: formation","stars: jets","ISM: jets and outflows","ISM: kinematics and dynamics","ISM: atoms","ISM: individual objects: NGC 1333","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis research was supported by the FFG ASAP-12 project JetPro* (FFG-854025) and in part by the EU FP7-2011 project under Grant Agreement No. 284405. \n","doctype":"article","read_count":26,"title":["Feedback of atomic jets from embedded protostars in NGC 1333"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T19:30:02.858Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016arXiv160901452L","2016A&A...597A..63L"],"identifier":["2016arXiv160901452L","2016A&A...597A..63L","2017A&A...597A..63L","10.1051/0004-6361/201628833","2016arXiv160901452L","2016A&A...597A..63L","1609.01452","10.1051/0004-6361/201628833"],"first_author":"Lanzafame, A.

Average stellar radii in open clusters can be estimated from rotation periods and projected rotational velocities under the assumption that the spin axis has a random orientation. These estimates are independent of distance, interstellar absorption, and models, but their validity can be limited by lacking data (truncation) or data that only represent upper or lower limits (censoring). <BR /> Aims: We present a new statistical analysis method to estimate average stellar radii in the presence of censoring and truncation. <BR /> Methods: We used theoretical distribution functions of the projected stellar radius Rsini to define a likelihood function in the presence of censoring and truncation. Average stellar radii in magnitude bins were then obtained by a maximum likelihood parametric estimation procedure. <BR /> Results: This method is capable of recovering the average stellar radius within a few percent with as few as aboutten measurements. Here we apply this for the first time to the dataset available for the Pleiades. We find an agreement better than ≈10 percent between the observed R vs. M<SUB>K</SUB> relationship and current standard stellar models for 1.2 ≥ M/M<SUB>☉</SUB> ≥ 0.85 with no evident bias.

There is an active debate about whether the properties of comets as observed today are primordial or, alternatively, if they are a result of collisional evolution or other processes. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the effects of collisions on a comet with a structure like 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P). We develop scaling laws for the critical specific impact energies Q<SUB>reshape</SUB> required for a significant shape alteration. These are then used in simulations of the combined dynamical and collisional evolution of comets in order to study the survival probability of a primordially formed object with a shape like 67P. Although the focus of this work is on a structure of this kind, the analysis is also performed for more generic bi-lobe shapes, for which we define the critical specific energy Q<SUB>bil</SUB>. The simulation outcomes are also analyzed in terms of impact heating and the evolution of the porosity. <BR /> Methods: The effects of impacts on comet 67P are studied using a state-of-the-art smooth particle hydrodynamics shock physics code. In the 3D simulations, a publicly available shape model of 67P is applied and a range of impact conditions and material properties are investigated. The resulting critical specific impact energy Q<SUB>reshape</SUB> (as well as Q<SUB>bil</SUB> for generic bi-lobe shapes) defines a minimal projectile size which is used to compute the number of shape-changing collisions in a set of dynamical simulations. These simulations follow the dispersion of the trans-Neptunian disk during the giant planet instability, the formation of a scattered disk, and produce 87 objects that penetrate into the inner solar system with orbits consistent with the observed JFC population. The collisional evolution before the giant planet instability is not considered here. Hence, our study is conservative in its estimation of the number of collisions. <BR /> Results: We find that in any scenario considered here, comet 67P would have experienced a significant number of shape-changing collisions, if it formed primordially. This is also the case for generic bi-lobe shapes. Our study also shows that impact heating is very localized and that collisionally processed bodies can still have a high porosity. <BR /> Conclusions: Our study indicates that the observed bi-lobe structure of comet 67P may not be primordial, but might have originated in a rather recent event, possibly within the last 1 Gy. This may be the case for any kilometer-sized two-component cometary nuclei.","read_count":40,"citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917682","page":["A61"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..61J","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Jutzi, M.","Benz, W.","Toliou, A.","Morbidelli, A.","Brasser, R."],"aff":["Physics Institute, University of Bern, NCCR PlanetS, Sidlerstrasse 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland","Physics Institute, University of Bern, NCCR PlanetS, Sidlerstrasse 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland","Department of Physics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, 54124, Thessaloniki, Greece; Laboratoire Lagrange, Université Côte d'Azur, CNRS, Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, 06304, Nice, France","Laboratoire Lagrange, Université Côte d'Azur, CNRS, Observatoire de la Côte d'Azur, 06304, Nice, France","Earth Life Science Institute, Tokyo Institute of Technology, Meguro-ku, 152-8550, Tokyo, Japan"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201628963"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["comets: general","comets: individual: 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko","Kuiper belt: general","planets and satellites: formation","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nM.J. and W.B. acknowledge support from the Swiss NCCR PlanetS.

We recently presented evidence that stable umbra-penumbra boundaries are characterised by a distinct canonical value of the vertical component of the magnetic field, B<SUP>stable</SUP><SUB>ver</SUB>. In order to trigger the formation of a penumbra, large inclinations in the magnetic field are necessary. In sunspots, the penumbra develops and establishes by colonising both umbral areas and granulation, that is, penumbral magneto-convection takes over in umbral regions with B<SUB>ver</SUB><B<SUP>stable</SUP><SUB>ver</SUB>, as well as in granular convective areas. Eventually, a stable umbra-penumbra boundary settles at B<SUP>stable</SUP><SUB>ver</SUB>. <BR /> Aims: Here, we aim to study the development of a penumbra initiated at the boundary of a pore, where the penumbra colonises the entire pore ultimately. <BR /> Methods: We have used Hinode/SOT G-band images to study the evolution of the penumbra. Hinode/SOT spectropolarimetric data were used to infer the magnetic field properties in the studied region. <BR /> Results: The penumbra forms at the boundary of a pore located close to the polarity inversion line of NOAA 10960. As the penumbral bright grains protrude into the pore, the magnetic flux in the forming penumbra increases at the expense of the pore magnetic flux. Consequently, the pore disappears completely giving rise to an orphan penumbra. At all times, the vertical component of the magnetic field in the pore is smaller than B<SUP>stable</SUP><SUB>ver</SUB> ≈ 1.8 kG. <BR /> Conclusions: Our findings are in an agreement with the need of B<SUP>stable</SUP><SUB>ver</SUB> for establishing a stable umbra-penumbra boundary: while B<SUB>ver</SUB> in the pore is smaller than B<SUP>stable</SUP><SUB>ver</SUB>, the protrusion of penumbral grains into the pore area is not blocked, a stable pore-penumbra boundary does not establish, and the pore is fully overtaken by the penumbral magneto-convective mode.

Doppler imaging (DI) is a powerful spectroscopic inversion technique that enables conversion of a line profile time series into a two-dimensional map of the stellar surface inhomogeneities. DI has been repeatedly applied to reconstruct chemical spot topologies of magnetic Ap/Bp stars with the goal of understanding variability of these objects and gaining an insight into the physical processes responsible for spot formation. <BR /> Aims: In this paper we investigate the accuracy of chemical abundance DI and assess the impact of several different systematic errors on the reconstructed spot maps. <BR /> Methods: We have simulated spectroscopic observational data for two different Fe spot distributions with a surface abundance contrast of 1.5 dex in the presence of a moderately strong dipolar magnetic field. We then reconstructed chemical maps using different sets of spectral lines and making different assumptions about line formation in the inversion calculations. <BR /> Results: Our numerical experiments demonstrate that a modern DI code successfully recovers the input chemical spot distributions comprised of multiple circular spots at different latitudes or an element overabundance belt at the magnetic equator. For the optimal reconstruction based on half a dozen spectral intervals, the average reconstruction errors do not exceed 0.10 dex. The errors increase to about 0.15 dex when abundance distributions are recovered from a few and/or blended spectral lines. Ignoring a 2.5 kG dipolar magnetic field in chemical abundance DI leads to an average relative error of 0.2 dex and maximum errors of 0.3 dex. Similar errors are encountered if a DI inversion is carried out neglecting a non-uniform continuum brightness distribution and variation of the local atmospheric structure. None of the considered systematic effects lead to major spurious features in the recovered abundance maps. <BR /> Conclusions: This series of numerical DI simulations proves that inversions based on one or two spectral lines with simplifying assumptions of the non-magnetic radiative transfer and a single model atmosphere are generally reliable provided that the stellar magnetic field is not much stronger than 2-3 kG and the recovered spot map has a contrast of at least 0.3 dex. In the light of these findings, we assess magnetic field strengths of several dozen Ap/Bp stars previously studied with DI methods, concluding that the vast majority of the published chemical spot maps are unaffected by the systematic errors addressed in this paper.","read_count":16,"citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917753","page":["A58"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..58K","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Kochukhov, O."],"aff":["Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University, Box 516, 75120, Uppsala, Sweden"],"orcid_pub":["-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629768"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["SIMBAD:42"],"keyword":["stars: atmospheres","stars: chemically peculiar","stars: magnetic field","starspots","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThe author thanks Drs.

The Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) under development by NASA is being planned to collect a multi-meter boulder from a near-Earth asteroid (NEA), and to bring it to the cis-lunar space in the mid-2020's for future study and exploitation by a crewed mission. The MarcoPolo-M5 project is being proposed in 2016 for the M5 mission opportunity by ESA, to bring back to Earth a sample from a very primitive D-type NEA. As D-types are very rare within the NEA population, considerable effort is still in progress to characterize easily accessible targets with unknown surface composition, in order to discover further asteroids that belong to this taxonomic group. <BR /> Aims: We aim to further characterize the physical properties of two optimal targets for sample return space missions, the low-∆V NEAs (341843) 2008 EV5 and (52381) 1993 HA. The asteroid 2008 EV5 is the baseline target of ARM, but only one spectrum of this object exists in the literature. The asteroid 1993 HA is a very favourable target for a space mission based on its dynamical properties: here we intend to assess if it is a suitable target for MarcoPolo-M5. <BR /> Methods: We obtained visible spectroscopy of 2008 EV5 with the FORS2 instrument at ESO-VLT (Paranal, Chile), at different rotational phases. We also obtained visible and near-infrared spectroscopy of 1993 HA, using the EFOSC2 and SOfI instruments at ESO-NTT (La Silla, Chile). Visible photometry of 1993 HA was carried out within the IMPACTON project at the Observatório Astronômico do Sertão de Itaparica (Itacuruba, Brazil). <BR /> Results: Our new observations are in agreement with the C-type classification of 2008 EV5, which is a requirement for the ARM mission. We obtained five visible spectra which do not show any variability within the limits of noise, suggesting a homogeneous surface. We obtained the first ever spectroscopic dataset ( 0.4-1.6 μm) for 1993 HA, finding a featureless, red-sloped behaviour typical of D-types (a T or X classification is also possible, with decreasing confidence). We also found that the synodic rotation period of 1993 HA is 4.107 ± 0.002 h, a value that is optimal for the execution of a sample return mission. The derived lightcurve also suggests an elongated shape (axis ratio a/b ≥ 1.71). At this stage 1993 HA does indeed seem to be the most favourable target for MarcoPolo-M5, though future observations are necessary to study it further. Based on observations collected at the European Organisation for Astronomical Research in the Southern Hemisphere under ESO programmes 290.C-5013 and 095.C-0087, and at the Observatório Astronômico do Sertão de Itaparica of the Observatório Nacional, Brazil.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14917714","page":["A57"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..57P","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Perna, D.","Popescu, M.","Monteiro, F.","Lantz, C.","Lazzaro, D.","Merlin, F."],"aff":["LESIA - Observatoire de Paris, PSL Research University, CNRS, Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ.

Detection of molecular oxygen and prediction of its abundance have long been a challenge for astronomers. The low abundances observed in few interstellar sources are well above the predictions of current astrochemical models. During the Rosetta mission, an unexpectedly high abundance of O<SUB>2</SUB> was discovered in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko's coma. A strong correlation between O<SUB>2</SUB> and H<SUB>2</SUB>O productions is observed, whereas no such correlation is observed between O<SUB>2</SUB> and either of CO or N<SUB>2</SUB>. <BR /> Aims: We suggest that the O<SUB>2</SUB> molecule may be formed during the evaporation of water ice. We propose a possible reaction: the dismutation of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> (2 H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>-→ 2 H<SUB>2</SUB>O + O<SUB>2</SUB>), a molecule which should be co-produced during the water ice mantle growth on dust grains. We aim to test this hypothesis under realistic experimental conditions. <BR /> Methods: We performed two sets of experiments. They consist of producing a mixture of D<SUB>2</SUB>O and D<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> via the reaction of O<SUB>2</SUB> and D on a surface held at 10 K. The first set is made on a silicate substrate, and explores the limit of thin films, in order to prevent any complication due to trapping during the desorption. The second set is performed on a pre-deposited H<SUB>2</SUB>O ice substrate and mimics the desorption of mixed ice. <BR /> Results: In thin films, O<SUB>2</SUB> is produced by the dismutation of H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>, even at temperatures as low as 155 K. Mixed with water, H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB> desorbs after the water ice sublimation and even more desorption of O<SUB>2</SUB> is observed. <BR /> Conclusions: H<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>2</SUB>, synthesised during the growth of interstellar ices (or by later processing), desorbs at the latest stage of the water sublimation and undergoes the dismutation reaction. Therefore an O<SUB>2</SUB> release in the gas phase should occur at the end of the evaporation of ice mantles. Temperature gradients along the geometry of clouds, or interior of comets, should blend the different stages of the sublimation. Averaged along the whole process, a mean value of the O<SUB>2</SUB>/H<SUB>2</SUB>O ratio of a few percent in the gas phase seems plausible.","read_count":8,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED"],"id":"14916508","page":["A56"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..56D","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Dulieu, F.","Minissale, M.","Bockelée-Morvan, D."],"aff":["LERMA, Université de Cergy Pontoise, Sorbonne Universités, UPMC Univ.

We report the discovery and analysis of very narrow transits in the eccentric spectroscopic binary HSS 348 (IC 4756). <BR /> Aims: The aim is to characterize the full HSS 348 system. <BR /> Methods: We obtained high-precision CoRoT photometry over two long runs and multi-epoch high-resolution échelle spectroscopy and imaging with STELLA. Standard radial-velocity extraction, spectrum synthesis, Fourier analysis, and light-curve inversions are applied to the data. <BR /> Results: HSS 348 is found to be an eccentric (e = 0.18) double-lined spectroscopic binary with a period of 12.47 d in which at least the primary component is a peculiar B star of the HgMn class. The orbital elements are such that the system undergoes a grazing eclipse with the primary in front but no secondary eclipse. The out-of-eclipse light variations show four nearly equidistant but unequal minima stable in shape and amplitude throughout our observations. Their individual photometric periods are all harmonics of the same fundamental period which happens to agree with the transit period to within the errors. We interpret the fundamental period to be the rotation period of at least one if not both stars due to surface inhomogeneities. Due to the non-zero eccentricity of the orbit the two components are rotating sub-synchronously. <BR /> Conclusions: It appears that HSS 348 is not a member of the IC 4756 cluster but a background B8+B8.5 binary system. Its sharp eclipses every 12.47 days just mimic a small-body transit but are in reality the grazing eclipses of a B-star binary and thus a classical false positive. The system seems to be pre-main sequence with the primary possibly just arrived on the ZAMS. The light curve with four unequal minima can be explained with four cool spots of different size equidistantly positioned in longitude. Our data do not allow to uniquely assign the spots to either of the two stars.

The unsurpassed sensitivity of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) takes the quest for discovering molecules in the warm and dense gas surrounding young stars to the next level. <BR /> Aims: Our aim is to start the process of compiling an inventory of oxygen-bearing complex organic molecules toward the solar-type Class 0 protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422 from an unbiased spectral survey with ALMA, Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS). Here we focus on the new detections of ethylene oxide (c-C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>O), acetone (CH<SUB>3</SUB>COCH<SUB>3</SUB>), and propanal (C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CHO). <BR /> Methods: With ALMA, we surveyed the spectral range from 329 to 363 GHz at 0.5″ (60 AU diameter) resolution. Using a simple model for the molecular emission in local thermodynamical equilibrium, the excitation temperatures and column densities of each species were constrained. <BR /> Results: We successfully detect propanal (44 lines), ethylene oxide (20 lines) and acetone (186 lines) toward one component of the protostellar binary, IRAS 16293B. The high resolution maps demonstrate that the emission for all investigated species originates from the compact central region close to the protostar. This, along with a derived common excitation temperature of T<SUB>ex</SUB> ≈ 125 K, is consistent with a coexistence of these molecules in the same gas. <BR /> Conclusions: The observations mark the first detections of acetone, propanal and ethylene oxide toward a low-mass protostar. The relative abundance ratios of the two sets of isomers, a CH<SUB>3</SUB>COCH<SUB>3</SUB>/C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>5</SUB>CHO ratio of 8 and a CH<SUB>3</SUB>CHO/c-C<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUB>4</SUB>O ratio of 12, are comparable to previous observations toward high-mass protostars. The majority of observed abundance ratios from these results as well as those measured toward high-mass protostars are up to an order of magnitude above the predictions from chemical models. This may reflect either missing reactions or uncertain rates in the chemical networks. The physical conditions, such as temperatures or densities, used in the models, may not be applicable to solar-type protostars either.","citation_count":10,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916597","page":["A53"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..53L","bibgroup":["NRAO/Telescopes","ALMA","ESO/Telescopes","CfA","NRAO","Leiden Observatory"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Lykke, J.

In solar-type stars, the attenuation of convective blueshift by stellar magnetic activity dominates the RV (radial velocity) variations over the low amplitude signal induced by low mass planets. Models of stars that differ from the Sun will require a good knowledge of the attenuation of the convective blueshift to estimate its impact on the variations. <BR /> Aims: It is therefore crucial to precisely determine not only the amplitude of the convective blueshift for different types of stars, but also the dependence of this convective blueshift on magnetic activity, as these are key factors in our model producing the RV. <BR /> Methods: We studied a sample of main sequence stars with spectral types from G0 to K2 and focused on their temporally averaged properties: the activity level and a criterion allowing to characterise the amplitude of the convective blueshift. This criterion is derived from the dependence of the convective blueshift with the intensity at the bottom of a large set of selected spectral lines. <BR /> Results: We find the differential velocity shifts of spectral lines due to convection to depend on the spectral type, the wavelength (this dependence is correlated with the T<SUB>eff</SUB> and activity level), and on the activity level. This allows us to quantify the dependence of granulation properties on magnetic activity for stars other than the Sun. We are indeed able to derive a significant dependence of the convective blueshift on activity level for all types of stars. The attenuation factor of the convective blueshift appears to be constant over the considered range of spectral types. We derive a convective blueshift which decreases towards lower temperatures, with a trend in close agreement with models for T<SUB>eff</SUB> lower than 5800 K, but with a significantly larger global amplitude. Differences also remain to be examined in detail for larger T<SUB>eff</SUB>. We finally compare the observed RV variation amplitudes with those that could be derived from our convective blueshift using a simple law and find a general agreement on the amplitude. We also show that inclination (viewing angle relative to the stellar equator) plays a major role in the dispersion in RV amplitudes. <BR /> Conclusions: Our results are consistent with previous results and provide, for the first time, an estimation of the convective blueshift as a function of T<SUB>eff</SUB>, magnetic activity, and wavelength, over a large sample of G and K main sequence stars.

We have collected broad-band photometric measurements in 14 wavelengths from available public surveys in order to study the spectral energy distribution (SED) of each galaxy in CASSIS, thus constructing a final sample of 1146 galaxies in the redshift range 0 < z < 2.5. The SEDs are modelled with the CIGALE code which relies on the energy balance between the absorbed stellar and the dust emission while taking into account the possible contribution due to the presence of an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We split the galaxies in three groups, a low-redshift (z < 0.1), a mid-redshift (0.1 ≤ z < 0.5) and a high-redshift (z ≥ 0.5) sub-sample and find that the vast majority of the Spitzer/IRS galaxies are star-forming and lie on or above the star-forming main sequence of the corresponding redshift. Moreover, the emission of Spitzer/IRS galaxies with z < 0.1 is mostly dominated by star-formation, galaxies in the mid-redshift bin are a mixture of star forming and AGN galaxies, while half of the galaxies with z ≥ 0.5 show moderate or high AGN activity. Additionally, using rest-frame NUV-r colour, Sérsic indices, optical [O<SUB>III</SUB>] and [N<SUB>II</SUB>] emission lines we explore the nature of these galaxies by investigating further their structure as well as their star-formation and AGN activity. Using a colour magnitude diagram we confirm that 97% of the galaxies with redshift smaller than 0.5 have experienced a recent star-formation episode. For a sub-sample of galaxies with available structural information and redshift smaller than 0.3 we find that early-type galaxies are placed below the main sequence, while late-type galaxies are found on the main-sequence as expected. Finally, for all the galaxies with redshift smaller than 0.5 and available optical spectral line measurements we compare the ability of CIGALE to detect the presence of an AGN in contrast to the optical spectra classification. We find that galaxies with high AGN luminosity, as calculated by CIGALE, are most likely to be classified as composite or AGNs by optical spectral lines.

Reflectance measurements from 0.5 to 25 μm and radiative transfer calculations were carried out in order to compare them with each other. <BR /> Results: Both the experimental simulations and modeling results indicate that the mid-infrared spectral features of olivine grains can survive the intense irradiations. Although the Christansen Feature is slightly shifted to longer wavelength, major vibrational bands remain essentially unchanged, because the lattice structure is quite immune to even the strongest irradiations, as revealed by both the X-ray diffraction and Raman scattering measurements. <BR /> Conclusions: Mid-infrared spectroscopy is much more immune to productions of nanophase irons and amorphous materials and thus may be used more reliably in remote detections of minerals on asteroid surfaces.","read_count":6,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916590","page":["A50"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..50Y","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Yang, Yazhou","Zhang, Hao","Wang, Ziwei","Yuan, Ye","Li, Shaolin","Hsu, Weibiao","Liu, Chujian"],"aff":["Planetary Science Institute, School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, PR China","Planetary Science Institute, School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, PR China ; Key Laboratory of Spectral Imaging Technology, Xi'an Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xi'an, 710119, PR China","Planetary Science Institute, School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, PR China","Planetary Science Institute, School of Earth Sciences, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, 430074, PR China","Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, PR China","Purple Mountain Observatory, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Nanjing, PR China","State Key Laboratory of Geological Process and Mineral Resources, China University of Geosciences, Wuhan, PR China"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629327"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["methods: laboratory: solid state","techniques: spectroscopic","radiative transfer","planets and satellites: surfaces","infrared: general","planets and satellites: composition"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank Sho Sasaki for helpful suggestions in the pulsed laser simulation system setup and Weidong Jin for programming the translation stage.

The sample comprises 300 galaxies displaying a wide range of morphologies across the Hubble sequence, from ellipticals to late-type spirals. This dataset allows us to homogeneously extract stellar kinematics up to several effective radii. In this paper, we describe the level of completeness of this subset of galaxies withrespect to the full CALIFA sample, as well as the virtues and limitations of the kinematic extraction compared to other well-known integral-field surveys. In addition, we provide averaged integrated velocity dispersion radial profiles for different galaxy types, which are particularly useful to apply aperture corrections for single aperture measurements or poorly resolved stellar kinematics of high-redshift sources. The work presented in this paper sets the basis for the study of more general properties of galaxies that will be explored in subsequent papers of the survey.","read_count":90,"citation_count":25,"year":"2017","property":["ASSOCIATED","DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916531","page":["A48"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..48F","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Falcón-Barroso, J.","Lyubenova, M.","van de Ven, G.","Mendez-Abreu, J.","Aguerri, J.

For all the detected binaries, we measured angular separations, position angles, and magnitude differences in the I band. We also calculated the masses of each individual component and estimated orbital periods, using the available magnitude and colour relations for M dwarfs and our own M<SUB>J</SUB>-spectral type and mass-M<SUB>I</SUB> relations. To avoid biases in our sample selection, we built a volume-limited sample of M0.0-M5.0 dwarfs that is complete up to 86% within 14 pc. <BR /> Results: From the 490 observed stars, we detected 80 companions in 76 systems, of which 30 are new discoveries. Another six companion candidates require additional astrometry to confirm physical binding. The multiplicity fraction in our observed sample is 16.7 ± 2.0%. The bias-corrected multiplicity fraction in our volume-limited sample is 19.5 ± 2.3% for angular separations of 0.2 to 5.0 arcsec (1.4-65.6 au), with a peak in the distribution of the projected physical separations at 2.5-7.5 au. For M0.0-M3.5 V primaries, our search is sensitive to mass ratios higher than 0.3 and there is a higher density of pairs with mass ratios over 0.8 compared to those at lower mass ratios. Binaries with projected physical separations shorter than 50 au also tend to be of equal mass. For 26 of our systems, we estimated orbital periods shorter than 50 a, 10 of which are presented here for the first time. We measured variations in angular separation and position angle that are due to orbital motions in 17 of these systems. The contribution of binaries and multiples with angular separations shorter than 0.2 arcsec, longer than 5.0 arcsec, and of spectroscopic binaries identified from previous searches, although not complete, may increase the multiplicity fraction of M dwarfs in our volume-limited sample to at least 36%.

Resonance spectral lines such as H I Ly α, Mg II H&K, and Ca II H&K that form in the solar chromosphere, are influenced by the effects of 3D radiative transfer as well as partial redistribution (PRD). So far no one has modeled these lines including both effects simultaneously owing to the high computing demands of existing algorithms. Such modeling is, however, indispensable for accurate diagnostics of the chromosphere. <BR /> Aims: We present a computationally tractable method to treat PRD scattering in 3D model atmospheres using a 3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer code. <BR /> Methods: To make the method memory-friendly, we use the hybrid approximation for the redistribution integral. To make the method fast, we use linear interpolation on equidistant frequency grids. We verify our algorithm against computations with the RH code and analyze it for stability, convergence, and usefulness of acceleration using model atoms of Mg II with the H&K lines and H I with the Ly α line treated in PRD. <BR /> Results: A typical 3D PRD solution can be obtained in a model atmosphere with 252 × 252 × 496 coordinate points in 50 000-200 000 CPU hours, which is a factor ten slower than computations assuming complete redistribution. We illustrate the importance of the joint action of PRD and 3D effects for the Mg II H&K lines for disk-center intensities, as well as the center-to-limb variation. <BR /> Conclusions: The proposed method allows for the simulation of PRD lines in a time series of radiation-magnetohydrodynamic models, in order to interpret observations of chromospheric lines at high spatial resolution.","read_count":36,"citation_count":10,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916603","page":["A46"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..46S","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Sukhorukov, Andrii V.","Leenaarts, Jorrit"],"aff":["Institute for Solar Physics, Department of Astronomy, Stockholm University, AlbaNova University Centre, 106 91, Stockholm, Sweden ; Main Astronomical Observatory, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, 27 Akademika Zabolotnoho str., 03680, Kyiv, Ukraine","Institute for Solar Physics, Department of Astronomy, Stockholm University, AlbaNova University Centre, 106 91, Stockholm, Sweden"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201629086"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","keyword":["radiative transfer","methods: numerical","Sun: chromosphere","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nComputations were performed on resources provided by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) at the National Supercomputer Centre at Linköping University, at the High Performance Computing Center North at Umeå University, and at PDC Centre for High Performance Computing (PDC-HPC) at the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

This detection has been made possible through absorption measurements of low-energy transitions of HDO, NH<SUB>3</SUB>, and C<SUB>3</SUB> against the bright background emitted by the star-forming region. We present a follow-up study of this core using the high sensitivity and high spectral resolution provided by the IRAM 30m telescope. We report new detections of this core in absorption for DCO<SUP>+</SUP> (2-1, 3-2), H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> (1-0), DNC (3-2), HN<SUP>13</SUP>C (1-0), p-H<SUB>2</SUB>CO (2<SUB>0,2</SUB>-1<SUB>0,1</SUB>, 3<SUB>0,3</SUB>-2<SUB>0,2</SUB>), and in emission for o-NH<SUB>2</SUB>D. We also report interferometric observation of this last species using the IRAM/NOEMA telescope, revealing the fragmented nature of the source through the detection of two cores, separated by 0.19-0.24 pc, with average sizes of less than 0.16-0.19 pc. From a non-LTE analysis, we are able to estimate the density ( 2.5 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) and temperature ( 10 K) of this component, typical of what is found in dark clouds. This component (called W51-core) has the same DCO<SUP>+</SUP>/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> ratio (0.02) as TMC-1 and a high DNC/HNC ratio (0.14). Detection of these deuterated species indicates that W51-core is similar to an early-phase low-mass star-forming region, formed from the interaction between the W51 giant molecular cloud and the high-velocity stream in front of it. The W51 complex being at about 5 kpc, these findings lead to what is the first detection of the earliest phase of low-mass star-forming region at such a large distance.

Far-IR emission can be used to estimate the star formation rate (SFR) and high dipole moment molecules, typically HCN, trace the dense gas. A strong correlation exists between HCN and far-IR emission, with the ratio being nearly constant, over a large range of physical scales. A few recent observations have found HCN to be weak with respect to the far-IR and CO in subsolar metallicity (low-Z) objects. We present observations of the Local Group galaxies M 33, IC 10, and NGC 6822 with the IRAM 30 m and NRO 45 m telescopes, greatly improving the sample of low-Z galaxies observed. HCN, HCO<SUP>+</SUP>, CS, C<SUB>2</SUB>H, and HNC have been detected. Compared to solar metallicity galaxies, the nitrogen-bearing species are weak (HCN, HNC) or not detected (CN, HNCO, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>) relative to far-IR or CO emission. HCO<SUP>+</SUP> and C<SUB>2</SUB>H emission is normal with respect to CO and far-IR. While <SUP>13</SUP>CO is the usual factor 10 weaker than <SUP>12</SUP>CO, C<SUP>18</SUP>O emission was not detected down to very low levels. Including earlier data, we find that the HCN/HCO<SUP>+</SUP> ratio varies with metallicity (O/H) and attribute this to the sharply decreasing nitrogen abundance. The dense gas fraction, traced by the HCN/CO and HCO<SUP>+</SUP>/CO ratios, follows the SFR but in the low-Z objects the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> is much easier to measure. Combined with larger and smaller scale measurements, the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> line appears to be an excellent tracer of dense gas and varies linearly with the SFR for both low and high metallicities.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916571","page":["A44"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..44B","bibgroup":["Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Braine, J.","Shimajiri, Y.","André, P.","Bontemps, S.","Gao, Yu","Chen, Hao","Kramer, C."],"aff":["Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Bordeaux, Univ.

Magnetic fields are invoked to launch, drive, and shape jets in both low- and high-mass protostars, but observational data on the spatial scales required to assess their role in the protostellar mass-loss process is still scarce. <BR /> Aims: The Turner-Welch (TW) object in the W3(OH) high-mass star-forming complex drives a synchrotron jet, which is quite exceptional for a high-mass protostar, and is associated with a strongly polarized H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser source, W3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O), making it an optimal target to investigate the role of magnetic fields on the innermost scales of protostellar disk-jet systems. <BR /> Methods: We report full polarimetric VLBA observations of H<SUB>2</SUB>O masers towards W3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O). Their linearly polarized emission provides clues on the orientation of the local magnetic field (on the plane of the sky), while the measurement of the Zeeman splitting provides its strength (along the line-of-sight). The linear scales probed by H<SUB>2</SUB>O masers are tens to hundreds of AU (at the W3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) distance, 2 kpc), inaccessible to other star-formation tracers. <BR /> Results: We identified a total of 148 individual maser features and we measured their physical properties. Out of 148, we measured linear polarization in 34 features, with a fractional percentage varying in the range 0.9-42%, making W3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) the highest-polarized H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser source observed with VLBI known in the Galaxy. The H<SUB>2</SUB>O masers trace a bipolar, biconical outflow at the center of the synchrotron jet. Although on scales of a few thousand AU the magnetic field inferred from the masers is on average orientated along the flow axis, on smaller scales (10s to 100s of AU), we have revealed a misalignment between the magnetic field and the velocity vectors, which arises from the compression of the field component along the shock front. We also detected circularly polarized emission toward ten maser features, with a fractional percentage varying in the range 0.2-1.6%. In the gas shocked by the synchrotron jet, we estimate a total field strength in the range 100-300 mG (at densities of 10<SUP>9</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>). We conclude that fields of this order of magnitude are expected if the observed polarized water masers emerge behind magnetically supported shocks which, propagating in the W3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O) hot core (with an initial density of order of 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), compress and enhance the field component perpendicular to the shock velocity (with an initial field strength of a few mG). We constrain the magnetic field strength in the pre-shock circumstellar gas (which is dominated by the component parallel to the flow motion) to at least 10-20 mG (at densities of 10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), consistent with previous estimates from a synchrotron jet model and dust polarization measurements. <BR /> Conclusions: In W3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O), the magnetic field would evolve from having a dominant component parallel to the outflow velocity in the pre-shock gas, with field strengths of the order of a few tens of mG, to being mainly dominated by the perpendicular component of order of a few hundred of mG in the post-shock gas where the H<SUB>2</SUB>O masers are excited. The general implication is that in the undisturbed (I.e., not-shocked) circumstellar gas, the flow velocities would follow closely the magnetic field lines, while in the shocked gas the magnetic field would be reconfigured to be parallel to the shock front.","citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916550","page":["A43"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..43G","bibgroup":["NRAO","Leiden Observatory","NRAO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Goddi, C.","Surcis, G.","Moscadelli, L.","Imai, H.","Vlemmings, W.

Understanding the diversity of planets requires studying the morphology and physical conditions in the protoplanetary disks in which they form. <BR /> Aims: We aim to study the structure of the 10 Myr old protoplanetary disk HD 100453, to detect features that can trace disk evolution and to understand the mechanisms that drive these features. <BR /> Methods: We observed HD 100453 in polarized scattered light with VLT/SPHERE at optical (0.6 μm, 0.8 μm) and near-infrared (1.2 μm) wavelengths, reaching an angular resolution of 0.02'', and an inner working angle of 0.09''. <BR /> Results: We spatially resolve the disk around HD 100453, and detect polarized scattered light up to 0.42'' ( 48 au). We detect a cavity, a rim with azimuthal brightness variations at an inclination of 38° with respect to our line of sight, two shadows and two symmetric spiral arms. The spiral arms originate near the location of the shadows, close to the semi major axis. We detect a faint feature in the SW that can be interpreted as the scattering surface of the bottom side of the disk, if the disk is tidally truncated by the M-dwarf companion currently seen at a projected distance of 119 au. We construct a radiative transfer model that accounts for the main characteristics of the features with an inner and outer disk misaligned by 72°. The azimuthal brightness variations along the rim are well reproduced with the scattering phase function of the model. While spirals can be triggered by the tidal interaction with the companion, the close proximity of the spirals to the shadows suggests that the shadows could also play a role. The change in stellar illumination along the rim induces an azimuthal variation of the scale height that can contribute to the brightness variations. <BR /> Conclusions: Dark regions in polarized images of transition disks are now detected in a handful of disks and often interpreted as shadows due to a misaligned inner disk. However, the origin of such a misalignment in HD 100453, and of the spirals, is still unclear, and might be due to a yet-undetected massive companion inside the cavity, and on an inclined orbit. Observations over a few years will allow us to measure the spiral pattern speed, and determine if the shadows are fixed or moving, which may constrain their origin.

Dusty star-forming galaxies are among the most prodigious systems at high redshift (z > 1), characterized by high star-formation rates and huge dust reservoirs. The bright end of this population has been well characterized in recent years, but considerable uncertainties remain for fainter dusty star-forming galaxies, which are responsible for the bulk of star formation at high redshift and thus play a key role in galaxy growth and evolution. <BR /> Aims: In this first paper of our series, we describe our methods for finding high redshift faint dusty galaxies using millimeter observations with ALMA. <BR /> Methods: We obtained ALMA 1.1 mm mosaic images for three strong-lensing galaxy clusters from the Frontier Fields Survey, which constitute some of the best studied gravitational lenses to date. The ≈2' × 2' mosaics overlap with the deep HST WFC3/IR footprints and encompass the high magnification regions of each cluster for maximum intrinsic source sensitivity. The combination of extremely high ALMA sensitivity and the magnification power of these clusters allows us to systematically probe the sub-mJy population of dusty star-forming galaxies over a large surveyed area. <BR /> Results: We present a description of the reduction and analysis of the ALMA continuum observations for the galaxy clusters Abell 2744 (z = 0.308), MACS J0416.1-2403 (z = 0.396) and MACS J1149.5+2223 (z = 0.543), for which we reach observed rms sensitivities of 55, 59 and 71 μJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> respectively. We detect 12 dusty star-forming galaxies at S/N ≥ 5.0 across the three clusters, all of them presenting coincidence with near-infrared detected counterparts in the HST images. None of the sources fall close to the lensing caustics, thus they are not strongly lensed. The observed 1.1 mm flux densities for the total sample of galaxies range from 0.41 to 2.82 mJy, with observed effective radii spanning ≲0.̋05 to 0.̋37 ± 0.̋21 . The lensing-corrected sizes of the detected sources appear to be in the same range as those measured in brighter samples, albeit with possibly larger dispersion.

Cyanopolyynes are chains of carbon atoms with an atom of hydrogen and a CN group on either side. They are detected almost everywhere in the interstellar medium (ISM), as well as in comets. In the past, they have been used to constrain the age of some molecular clouds, since their abundance is predicted to be a strong function of time. Finally, cyanopolyynes can potentially contain a large portion of molecular carbon. <BR /> Aims: We present an extensive study of the cyanopolyynes distribution in the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293-2422. The goals are (I) to obtain a census of the cyanopolyynes in this source and of their isotopologues; (II) to derive how their abundance varies across the protostar envelope; and (III) to obtain constraints on the history of IRAS 16293-2422 by comparing the observations with the predictions of a chemical model. <BR /> Methods: We analysed the data from the IRAM-30 m unbiased millimeter and submillimeter spectral survey towards IRAS 16293-2422 named TIMASSS. The derived spectral line energy distribution (SLED) of each detected cyanopolyyne was compared with the predictions from the radiative transfer code GRenoble Analysis of Protostellar Envelope Spectra (GRAPES) to derive the cyanopolyyne abundances across the envelope of IRAS 16293-2422. Finally, the derived abundances were compared with the predictions of the chemical model UCL_CHEM. <BR /> Results: We detect several lines from cyanoacetylene (HC<SUB>3</SUB>N) and cyanodiacetylene (HC<SUB>5</SUB>N), and report the first detection of deuterated cyanoacetylene, DC<SUB>3</SUB>N, in a solar-type protostar. We found that the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N abundance is roughly constant ( 1.3 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP>) in the outer cold envelope of IRAS 16293-2422, and it increases by about a factor 100 in the inner region where the dust temperature exceeds 80 K, namely when the volcano ice desorption is predicted to occur. The HC<SUB>5</SUB>N has an abundance similar to HC<SUB>3</SUB>N in the outer envelope and about a factor of ten lower in the inner region. The comparison with the chemical model predictions provides constraints on the oxygen and carbon gaseous abundance in the outer envelope and, most importantly, on the age of the source. The HC<SUB>3</SUB>N abundance derived in the inner region, and where the increase occurs, also provide strong constraints on the time taken for the dust to warm up to 80 K, which has to be shorter than 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> yr. Finally, the cyanoacetylene deuteration is about 50% in the outer envelope and ≤5% in the warm inner region. The relatively low deuteration in the warm region suggests that we are witnessing a fossil of the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N abundantly formed in the tenuous phase of the pre-collapse and then frozen into the grain mantles at a later phase. <BR /> Conclusions: The accurate analysis of the cyanopolyynes in IRAS 16293-2422 unveils an important part of its past story. It tells us that IRAS 16293-2422 underwent a relatively fast (≤10<SUP>5</SUP> yr) collapse and a very fast (≤10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> yr) warming up of the cold material to 80 K.","read_count":42,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916534","page":["A40"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..40J","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Jaber Al-Edhari, A.","Ceccarelli, C.","Kahane, C.","Viti, S.","Balucani, N.","Caux, E.","Faure, A.","Lefloch, B.","Lique, F.","Mendoza, E.","Quenard, D.","Wiesenfeld, L."],"aff":["Univ.

The epicyclic approximation allows the determination of the corresponding resonant radii on the equatorial plane (in the context of nearly circular orbits), but is not suitable in general. <BR /> Aims: We expand the study of resonant orbits by analysing stellar motions perturbed by spiral arms with Gaussian-shaped groove profiles without any restriction on the stellar orbital configurations, and we expand the concept of Lindblad (epicyclic) resonances for orbits with large radial excursions. <BR /> Methods: We define a representative plane of initial conditions, which covers the whole phase space of the system. Dynamical maps on representative planes of initial conditions are constructed numerically in order to characterize the phase-space structure and identify the precise location of the co-rotation and Lindblad resonances. The study is complemented by the construction of dynamical power spectra, which provide the identification of fundamental oscillatory patterns in the stellar motion. <BR /> Results: Our approach allows a precise description of the resonance chains in the whole phase space, giving a broader view of the dynamics of the system when compared to the classical epicyclic approach. We generalize the concept of Lindblad resonances and extend it to cases of resonant orbits with large radial excursions, even for objects in retrograde motion. The analysis of the solar neighbourhood shows that, depending on the current azimuthal phase of the Sun with respect to the spiral arms, a star with solar kinematic parameters (SSP) may evolve in dynamically distinct regions, either inside the stable co-rotation resonance or in a chaotic zone. <BR /> Conclusions: Our approach contributes to quantifying the domains of resonant orbits and the degree of chaos in the whole Galactic phase-space structure. It may serve as a starting point to apply these techniques to the investigation of clumps in the distribution of stars in the Galaxy, such as kinematic moving groups.","read_count":35,"citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916605","page":["A39"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..39M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Michtchenko, T.

We determined how sensitive our parameter predictions depend on (1) different estimates of bulk abundance constraints and (2) different correlations of bulk abundances between planet and host star. <BR /> Results: The possible interior structures and correlations between structural parameters differ depending on data and data uncertainty. The strongest correlation is generally found between size of rocky interior and water mass fraction. Given the data, possible water mass fractions are high, even for most potentially rocky planets (HD 219134b, Kepler-93b, CoRoT-7b, and 55 Cnc e with estimates up to 35%, depending on the planet). Also, the interior of Kepler-10b is best constrained with possible interiors similar to Earth. Among all tested planets, only the data of Kepler-10b and Kepler-93b allow to put a higher probability on the planetary bulk Fe/Si to be stellar compared to extremely sub-stellar. <BR /> Conclusions: Although the possible ranges of interior structures are large, structural parameters and their correlations are constrained by the sparse data. The probability for the tested exoplanets to be Earth-like is generally very low.

Our methodology succeeds in quantifying the degeneracy and correlation of structural parameters for high dimensional parameter spaces. Specifically, we identify what constraints can be placed on composition and thickness of core, mantle, ice, ocean, and atmospheric layers given observations of mass, radius, and bulk refractory abundance constraints (Fe, Mg, Si) from observations of the host star's photospheric composition. <BR /> Methods: We employed a full probabilistic Bayesian inference analysis that formally accounts for observational and model uncertainties. Using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we computed joint and marginal posterior probability distributions for all structural parameters of interest. We included state-of-the-art structural models based on self-consistent thermodynamics of core, mantle, high-pressure ice, and liquid water. Furthermore, we tested and compared two different atmospheric models that are tailored for modeling thick and thin atmospheres, respectively. <BR /> Results: First, we validate our method against Neptune. Second, we apply it to synthetic exoplanets of fixed mass and determine the effect on interior structure and composition when (1) radius; (2) atmospheric model; (3) data uncertainties; (4) semi-major axes; (5) atmospheric composition (I.e., a priori assumption of enriched envelopes versus pure H/He envelopes); and (6) prior distributions are varied. <BR /> Conclusions: Our main conclusions are: (1) given available data, the range of possible interior structures is large; quantification of the degeneracy of possible interiors is therefore indispensable for meaningful planet characterization. (2) Our method predicts models that agree with independent estimates of Neptune's interior. (3) Increasing the precision in mass and radius leads to much improved constraints on ice mass fraction, size of rocky interior, but little improvement in the composition of the gas layer, whereas an increase in the precision of stellar abundances enables to better constrain mantle composition and relative core size; (4) for thick atmospheres, the choice of atmospheric model can have significant influence on interior predictions, including the rocky and icy interior. The preferred atmospheric model is determined by envelope mass. This study provides a methodology for rigorously analyzing general interior structures of exoplanets which may help to understand how exoplanet interior types are distributed among star systems. This study is relevant in the interpretation of future data from missions such as TESS, CHEOPS, and PLATO.","read_count":38,"citation_count":6,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916570","page":["A37"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..37D","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Dorn, Caroline","Venturini, Julia","Khan, Amir","Heng, Kevin","Alibert, Yann","Helled, Ravit","Rivoldini, Attilio","Benz, Willy"],"aff":["Physics Institute, University of Bern, Sidlerstrasse 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland","Physics Institute, University of Bern, Sidlerstrasse 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland","Institute of Geophysics, ETH Zürich, Sonneggstrasse 5, 8092, Zürich, Switzerland","Physics Institute, University of Bern, Sidlerstrasse 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland","Physics Institute, University of Bern, Sidlerstrasse 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland","Department of Geosciences, Raymond & Beverly Sackler Faculty of Exact Sciences, Tel Aviv University, 69978, Tel Aviv, Israel","Royal Observatory of Belgium, Earth Rotation and Space Geodesy, 1180, Bruxelles, Belgium","Physics Institute, University of Bern, Sidlerstrasse 5, 3012, Bern, Switzerland"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201628708"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["SIMBAD:6"],"keyword":["methods: statistical","planets and satellites: interiors","stars: abundances","planets and satellites: composition","planets and satellites: atmospheres","methods: analytical","Astrophysics - Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis work was supported by the Swiss National Foundation under grant 15-144, the ERC grant 239605.

The flight calibration of the spectral response of charge-coupled device (CCD) instruments below 1.5 keV is difficult in general because of the lack of strong lines in the on-board calibration sources typically available. This calibration is also a function of time due to the effects of radiation damage on the CCDs and/or the accumulation of a contamination layer on the filters or CCDs. <BR /> Aims: We desire a simple comparison of the absolute effective areas of the current generation of CCD instruments onboard the following observatories: Chandra ACIS-S3, XMM-Newton (EPIC-MOS and EPIC-pn), Suzaku XIS, and Swift XRT and a straightforward comparison of the time-dependent response of these instruments across their respective mission lifetimes. <BR /> Methods: We have been using 1E 0102.2-7219, the brightest supernova remnant in the Small Magellanic Cloud, to evaluate and modify the response models of these instruments. 1E 0102.2-7219 has strong lines of O, Ne, and Mg below 1.5 keV and little or no Fe emission to complicate the spectrum. The spectrum of 1E 0102.2-7219 has been well-characterized using the RGS gratings instrument on XMM-Newton and the HETG gratings instrument on Chandra. As part of the activities of the International Astronomical Consortium for High Energy Calibration (IACHEC), we have developed a standard spectral model for 1E 0102.2-7219 and fit this model to the spectra extracted from the CCD instruments. The model is empirical in that it includes Gaussians for the identified lines, an absorption component in the Galaxy, another absorption component in the SMC, and two thermal continuum components with different temperatures. In our fits, the model is highly constrained in that only the normalizations of the four brightest lines/line complexes (the O vii Heα triplet, O viii Lyα line, the Ne ix Heα triplet, and the Ne x Lyα line) and an overall normalization are allowed to vary, while all other components are fixed. We adopted this approach to provide a straightforward comparison of the measured line fluxes at these four energies. We have examined these measured line fluxes as a function of time for each instrument after applying the most recent calibrations that account for the time-dependent response of each instrument. <BR /> Results: We performed our effective area comparison with representative, early mission data when the radiation damage and contamination layers were at a minimum, except for the XMM-Newton EPIC-pn instrument which is stable in time. We found that the measured fluxes of the O vii Heαr line, the O viii Lyα line, the Ne ix Heαr line, and the Ne x Lyα line generally agree to within ±10% for all instruments, with 38 of our 48 fitted normalizations within ± 10% of the IACHEC model value. We then fit all available observations of 1E 0102.2-7219 for the CCD instruments close to the on-axis position to characterize the time dependence in the 0.5-1.0 keV band. We present the measured line normalizations as a function of time for each CCD instrument so that the users may estimate the uncertainty in their measured line fluxes for the epoch of their observations.","citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916554","page":["A35"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..35P","bibgroup":["XMM","CXC","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Plucinsky, Paul P.","Beardmore, Andrew P.","Foster, Adam","Haberl, Frank","Miller, Eric D.","Pollock, Andrew M.

More than two thousand exoplanets have been discovered to date. Of these, only a small fraction have been detected around solar twins, which are key stars because we can obtain accurate elemental abundances especially for them, which is crucial for studying the planet-star chemical connection with the highest precision. <BR /> Aims: We aim to use solar twins to characterise the relationship between planet architecture and stellar chemical composition. <BR /> Methods: We obtained high-precision (1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>) radial velocities with the HARPS spectrograph on the ESO 3.6 m telescope at La Silla Observatory and determined precise stellar elemental abundances ( 0.01 dex) using spectra obtained with the MIKE spectrograph on the Magellan 6.5 m telescope. <BR /> Results: Our data indicate the presence of a planet with a minimum mass of 26 ± 4 Earth masses around the solar twin HIP 68468. The planet is more massive than Neptune (17 Earth masses), but unlike the distant Neptune in our solar system (30 AU), HIP 68468c is close-in, with a semi-major axis of 0.66 AU, similar to that of Venus. The data also suggest the presence of a super-Earth with a minimum mass of 2.9 ± 0.8 Earth masses at 0.03 AU; if the planet is confirmed, it will be the fifth least massive radial velocity planet candidate discovery to date and the first super-Earth around a solar twin. Both isochrones (5.9 ± 0.4 Gyr) and the abundance ratio [Y/Mg] (6.4 ± 0.8 Gyr) indicate an age of about 6 billion years. The star is enhanced in refractory elements when compared to the Sun, and the refractory enrichment is even stronger after corrections for Galactic chemical evolution. We determined a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium Li abundance of 1.52 ± 0.03 dex, which is four times higher than what would be expected for the age of HIP 68468. The older age is also supported by the low log () (-5.05) and low jitter (<1 m s<SUP>-1</SUP>). Engulfment of a rocky planet of 6 Earth masses can explain the enhancement in both lithium and the refractory elements. <BR /> Conclusions: The super-Neptune planet candidate is too massive for in situ formation, and therefore its current location is most likely the result of planet migration that could also have driven other planets towards its host star, enhancing thus the abundance of lithium and refractory elements in HIP 68468. The intriguing evidence of planet accretion warrants further observations to verify the existence of the planets that are indicated by our data and to better constrain the nature of the planetary system around this unique star.","citation_count":8,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916580","page":["A34"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..34M","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Meléndez, Jorge","Bedell, Megan","Bean, Jacob L.","Ramírez, Iván","Asplund, Martin","Dreizler, Stefan","Yan, Hong-Liang","Shi, Jian-Rong","Lind, Karin","Ferraz-Mello, Sylvio","Galarza, Jhon Yana","dos Santos, Leonardo","Spina, Lorenzo","Maia, Marcelo Tucci","Alves-Brito, Alan","Monroe, TalaWanda","Casagrande, Luca"],"aff":["Universidade de São Paulo, IAG, Departamento de Astronomia, Rua do Matão 1226, Cidade Universitária, 05508-900, São Paulo, SP, Brazil","University of Chicago, Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, 5640 S.

We critically compared the StePar results with other methods (T<SUB>eff</SUB> values derived using the infrared flux method (IRFM) and log g values based on Hipparcos parallaxes). We derived the chemical abundances of 20 elements and their [X/Fe] ratios for all stars in the sample. We performed a differential abundance analysis with respect to a reference star of the UMa MG (HD 115043). We also carried out a systematic comparison of the abundance pattern of the Ursa Major MG and the Hyades SC with the thin disk stellar abundances. <BR /> Results: Our chemical tagging analysis indicates that the Ursa Major MG is less affected by field star contamination than other moving groups (such as the Hyades SC). We find a roughly solar iron composition [Fe/H] = 0.03 ± 0.07 dex for the finally selected stars, whereas the [X/Fe] ratios are roughly subsolar except for super-solar Barium abundance. <BR /> Conclusions: We conclude that 29 out of 44 (I.e., 66%) candidate stars have similar chemical compositions. In addition, we find that the abundance pattern of the Ursa Major MG might be marginally different from that of the Hyades SC.

Gaps, cavities, and rings in circumstellar disks are signposts of disk evolution and planet-disk interactions. We follow the recent suggestion that Herbig Ae/Be disks with a flared disk harbor a cavity, and investigate the disk around HD 97048. <BR /> Aims: We aim to resolve the 34 ± 4 AU central cavity that has been predicted and to investigate the structure of the disk. <BR /> Methods: We imaged the disk around HD 97048 using ALMA at 0.85 mm and 2.94 mm and ATCA (multiple frequency) observations. Our observations also include the <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 1-0, <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3-2 and HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 4-3 emission lines. <BR /> Results: A central cavity in the disk around HD 97048 is resolved with a 40-46 AU radius. Additional radial structure present in the surface brightness profile can be accounted for either by an opacity gap at 90 AU or by an additional emitting ring at 150 AU. The continuum emission tracing the dust in the disk is detected out to 355 AU. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO J = 3-2 disk is detected 2.4 times farther out. The <SUP>12</SUP>CO emission can be traced down to ≈10 AU scales. Apparent non-Keplerian kinematics are detected inside the cavity on the HCO<SUP>+</SUP> J = 4-3 velocity map. The mm spectral index measured from ATCA observations suggests that grain growth has occurred in the HD 97048 disk. Finally, we resolve a highly inclined disk out to 150 AU around the nearby 0.5 M<SUB>☉</SUB> binary ISO-ChaI 126. <BR /> Conclusions: The data presented here reveal a cavity in the disk of HD 97048, and prominent radial structure in the surface brightness. The cavity size varies for different continuum frequencies and gas tracers. The gas inside the cavity follows non-Keplerian kinematics seen in HCO<SUP>+</SUP> emission. The variable cavity size along with the kinematical signature suggests the presence of a substellar companion or a massive planet inside the cavity.","citation_count":25,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916526","page":["A32"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..32V","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes","ALMA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["van der Plas, G.","Wright, C.

Most of the quantitative information about the magnetic field vector in solar prominences comes from the analysis of the Hanle effect acting on lines formed by scattering. As these lines can be of non-negligible optical thickness, it is of interest to study the line formation process further. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the multidimensional effects on the interpretation of spectropolarimetric observations, particularly on the inference of the magnetic field vector. We do this by analyzing the differences between multidimensional models, which involve fully self-consistent radiative transfer computations in the presence of spatial inhomogeneities and velocity fields, and those which rely on simple one-dimensional geometry. <BR /> Methods: We study the formation of a prototype line in ad hoc inhomogeneous, isothermal 2D prominence models. We solve the NLTE polarized line formation problem in the presence of a large-scale oriented magnetic field. The resulting polarized line profiles are then interpreted (I.e. inverted) assuming a simple 1D slab model. <BR /> Results: We find that differences between input and the inferred magnetic field vector are non-negligible. Namely, we almost universally find that the inferred field is weaker and more horizontal than the input field. <BR /> Conclusions: Spatial inhomogeneities and radiative transfer have a strong effect on scattering line polarization in the optically thick lines. In real-life situations, ignoring these effects could lead to a serious misinterpretation of spectropolarimetric observations of chromospheric objects such as prominences.","read_count":23,"citation_count":0,"year":"2017","property":["ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916599","page":["A31"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..31M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Milić, I.","Faurobert, M.","Atanacković, O."],"aff":["Max-Planck-Institut für Sonnersystemforschung, Justus-von-Liebig-Weg 3, 37077, Göttingen, Germany ; Astronomical Observatory Belgrade, Volgina 7, 11060, Belgrade, Serbia","UMR 7293 J.

We present the CoRoGEE dataset, obtained from CoRoT light curves for 606 red giants in two fields of the Galactic disc that have been co-observed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE). We used the Bayesian parameter estimation code PARAM to calculate distances, extinctions, masses, and ages for these stars in a homogeneous analysis, resulting in relative statistical uncertainties of ≲2% in distance, 4% in radius, 9% in mass and 25% in age. We also assessed systematic age uncertainties stemming from different input physics and mass loss. We discuss the correlation between ages and chemical abundance patterns of field stars over a broad radial range of the Milky Way disc (5 kpc <R<SUB>Gal</SUB>< 14 kpc), focussing on the [α/Fe]-[Fe/H]-age plane in five radial bins of the Galactic disc. We find an overall agreement with the expectations of pure chemical-evolution models computed before the present data were available, especially for the outer regions. However, our data also indicate that a significant fraction of stars now observed near and beyond the solar neighbourhood migrated from inner regions. Mock CoRoGEE observations of a chemodynamical Milky Way disc model indicate that the number of high-metallicity stars in the outer disc is too high to be accounted for even by the strong radial mixing present in the model. The mock observations also show that the age distribution of the [α/Fe]-enhanced sequence in the CoRoGEE inner-disc field is much broader than expected from a combination of radial mixing and observational errors. We suggest that a thick-disc/bulge component that formed stars for more than 3 Gyr may account for these discrepancies. Our results are subject to future improvements due to (a) the still low statistics, because our sample had to be sliced into bins of Galactocentric distances and ages; (b) large uncertainties in proper motions (and therefore guiding radii); and (c) corrections to the asteroseismic mass-scaling relation. The situation will improve not only upon the upcoming Gaia data releases, but also with the foreseen increase in the number of stars with both seismic and spectroscopic information.

The classic question of how young massive star clusters attain the shapes and sizes, as we find them today, is still a difficult one. Both observational and computational studies of star-forming massive molecular gas clouds suggest that massive cluster formation is primarily triggered along the small-scale (≲0.3 pc) filamentary substructures within the clouds. <BR /> Aims: The present study investigates the possible ways in which a filament-like, compact, massive star cluster (effective radius 0.1-0.3 pc) can expand more than 10 times, still remaining massive enough (≳ 10<SUP>4</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>) to become the young massive star cluster that we observe today. <BR /> Methods: To this end, model massive clusters (initially 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>) are evolved using Sverre Aarseth's state-of-the-art N-body code NBODY7. Apart from the accurate calculation of two-body relaxation of the constituent stars, these evolutionary models take into account stellar-evolutionary mass loss and dynamical energy injection due to massive, tight primordial binaries and stellar-remnant black holes and neutron stars. These calculations also include a solar-neighbourhood-like external tidal field. All the computed clusters expand with time, and their sizes (effective radii) are compared with those observed for young massive clusters (≲ 100 Myr) in the Milky Way and other nearby galaxies. <BR /> Results: In this study, it is found that beginning from the above compact sizes, a star cluster cannot expand on its own, I.e., due to two-body relaxation, stellar mass loss, and dynamical heating by primordial binaries and compact stars up to the observed sizes of young massive clusters; star clusters always remain much more compact than the observed ones. <BR /> Conclusions: This calls for additional mechanisms that boost the expansion of a massive cluster after its assembly. Using further N-body calculations, it is shown that a substantial residual gas expulsion with ≈ 30% star formation efficiency can indeed swell the newborn embedded cluster adequately. The limitations of the present calculations and their consequences are discussed.","read_count":41,"citation_count":11,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916522","page":["A28"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..28B","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Banerjee, Sambaran","Kroupa, Pavel"],"aff":["Argelander-Institut für Astronomie (AIfA), Auf dem Hügel 71, 53121, Bonn, Germany ; Helmholtz-Instituts für Strahlen- und Kernphysik (HISKP), Nussallee 14-16, 53115, Bonn, Germany","Helmholtz-Instituts für Strahlen- und Kernphysik (HISKP), Nussallee 14-16, 53115, Bonn, Germany"],"orcid_pub":["-","-"],"orcid_other":["0000-0002-1254-2603","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201526928"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["NED:3","SIMBAD:125"],"keyword":["galaxies: star clusters: general","methods: numerical","star: formation","stars: kinematics and dynamics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nWe thank the referee for constructive criticisms that led to substantial improvements of the description and discussions in the paper. \n","doctype":"article","orcid_user":["-","-"],"title":["How can young massive clusters reach their present-day sizes?"],"indexstamp":"2018-01-08T19:47:49.734Z"},{"arxiv_class":["Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"alternate_bibcode":["2016A&A...597A..27S","2016arXiv160906455S"],"identifier":["2016A&A...597A..27S","2016arXiv160906455S","2017A&A...597A..27S","10.1051/0004-6361/201629288","1609.06455","2016A&A...597A..27S","10.1051/0004-6361/201629288","2016arXiv160906455S"],"first_author":"Santander-García, M.","abstract":"Context. The mechanism behind the shaping of bipolar planetary nebulae is still poorly understood. It is becoming increasingly clear that the main agents must operate at their innermost regions, where a significant equatorial density enhancement should be present and related to the collimation of light and jet launching from the central star preferentially towards the polar directions. Most of the material in this equatorial condensation must be lost during the asymptotic giant branch as stellar wind and later released from the surface of dust grains to the gas phase in molecular form. Accurately tracing the molecule-rich regions of these objects can give valuable insight into the ejection mechanisms themselves. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the physical conditions, structure and velocity field of the dense molecular region of the planetary nebula NGC 6302 by means of ALMA band 7 interferometric maps. <BR /> Methods: The high spatial resolution of the <SUP>12</SUP>CO and <SUP>13</SUP>CO J = 3-2 ALMA data allows for an analysis of the geometry of the ejecta in unprecedented detail. We built a spatio-kinematical model of the molecular region with the software SHAPE and performed detailed non-LTE calculations of excitation and radiative transfer with the shapemol plug-in. <BR /> Results: We find that the molecular region consists of a massive ring out of which a system of fragments of lobe walls emerge and enclose the base of the lobes visible in the optical. The general properties of this region are in agreement with previous works, although the much greater spatial resolution of the data allows for a very detailed description. We confirm that the mass of the molecular region is 0.1 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. Additionally, we report a previously undetected component at the nebular equator, an inner, younger ring inclined 60° with respect to the main ring, showing a characteristic radius of 7.5 × 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm, a mass of 2.7 × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>, and a counterpart in optical images of the nebula. This inner ring has the same kinematical age as the northwest optical lobes, implying it was ejected approximately at the same time, hundreds of years after the ejection of the bulk of the molecular ring-like region. We discuss a sequence of events leading to the formation of the molecular and optical nebulae, and briefly speculate on the origin of this intriguing inner ring.

It transits a bright K star at a moderate orbital distance of 0.08 au. Its low density is compatible with a massive steam envelope that could photodissociate at high altitudes and become observable as escaping neutral hydrogen. Our analysis of three transits with HST/STIS at Lyman-α reveals no such signature, suggesting that the thermosphere of HD 97658 b is not hydrodynamically expanding and is subjected to a low escape of neutral hydrogen (<10<SUP>8</SUP> g s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 3σ). Using HST/STIS Lyman-α observations and Chandra/ACIS-S and XMM-Newton/EPIC X-ray observations at different epochs, we find that HD 97658 is in fact a weak and soft X-ray source with signs of chromospheric variability in the Lyman-α line core. We determine an average reference for the intrinsic Lyman-α line and X-EUV (XUV) spectrum of the star, and show that HD 97658 b is in mild conditions of irradiation compared to other known evaporating exoplanets with an XUV irradiation about three times lower than the evaporating warm Neptune GJ436 b. This could be the reason why the thermosphere of HD 97658 b is not expanding: the low XUV irradiation prevents an efficient photodissociation of any putative steam envelope. Alternatively, it could be linked to a low hydrogen content or inefficient conversion of the stellar energy input. The HD 97658 system provides clues for understanding the stability of low-mass planet atmospheres in terms of composition, planetary density, and irradiation. Our study of HD 97658 b can be seen as a control experiment of our methodology, confirming that it does not bias detections of atmospheric escape and underlining its strength and reliability. Our results show that stellar activity can be efficiently discriminated from absorption signatures by a transiting exospheric cloud. They also highlight the potential of observing the upper atmosphere of small transiting planets to probe their physical and chemical properties.","citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916547","page":["A26"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..26B","bibgroup":["XMM","CXC","HST"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Bourrier, V.","Ehrenreich, D.","King, G.","Lecavelier des Etangs, A.","Wheatley, P.

In particular, we highlight the detection of NS and H<SUB>2</SUB>CO with fractional abundances of f(NS) 10<SUP>-8</SUP> and f(H<SUB>2</SUB>CO) [10<SUP>-7</SUP>-10<SUP>-8</SUP>]. Most of the molecules display rotational temperatures between 15 and 40 K. NaCl and SiS isotopologues display rotational temperatures higher than the average ( 65 K). In the case of SO<SUB>2</SUB> a warm component with T<SUB>rot</SUB> 290 K is also detected. <BR /> Conclusions: With a total of 350 lines detected of 34 different molecular species (including different isotopologues), <ASTROBJ>IK Tau</ASTROBJ> displays a rich chemistry for an oxygen-rich circumstellar envelope. The detection of carbon bearing molecules like H<SUB>2</SUB>CO, as well as the discrepancies found between our derived abundances and the predictions from chemical models for some molecules, highlight the need for a revision of standard chemical models. We were able to identify at least two different emission components in terms of rotational temperatures. The warm component, which is mainly traced out by SO<SUB>2</SUB>, is probably arising from the inner regions of the envelope (at ≲8 R<SUB>∗</SUB>) where SO<SUB>2</SUB> has a fractional abundance of f(SO<SUB>2</SUB>) 10<SUP>-6</SUP>. This result should be considered for future investigation of the main formation channels of this, and other, parent species in the inner winds of O-rich AGB stars, which at present are not well reproduced by current chemistry models.

The galaxy cluster Abell S1101 (S1101 hereafter) deviates significantly from the X-ray luminosity versus velocity dispersion relation (L-σ) of galaxy clusters in our previous study. Given reliable X-ray luminosity measurement combining XMM-Newton and ROSAT, this could most likely be caused by the bias in the velocity dispersion due to interlopers and low member statistic in the previous sample of member galaxies, which was solely based on 20 galaxy redshifts drawn from the literature. <BR /> Aims: We intend to increase the galaxy member statistics to perform precision measurements of the velocity dispersion and dynamical mass of S1101. We aim for a detailed substructure and dynamical state characterization of this cluster, and a comparison of mass estimates derived from (I) the velocity dispersion (M<SUB>vir</SUB>), (II) the caustic mass computation (M<SUB>caustic</SUB>), and (III) mass proxies from X-ray observations and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. <BR /> Methods: We carried out new optical spectroscopic observations of the galaxies in this cluster field with VIMOS, obtaining a sample of 60 member galaxies for S1101. We revised the cluster redshift and velocity dispersion measurements based on this sample and also applied the Dressler-Shectman substructure test. <BR /> Results: The completeness of cluster members within r<SUB>200</SUB> was significantly improved for this cluster. Tests for dynamical substructure do not show evidence of major disturbances or merging activities in S1101. We find good agreement between the dynamical cluster mass measurements and X-ray mass estimates, which confirms the relaxed state of the cluster displayed in the 2D substructure test. The SZ mass proxy is slightly higher than the other estimates. The updated measurement of σ erased the deviation of S1101 in the L-σ relation. We also noticed a background structure in the cluster field of S1101. This structure is a galaxy group that is very close to the cluster S1101 in projection but at almost twice its redshift. However the mass of this structure is too low to significantly bias the observed bolometric X-ray luminosity of S1101. Hence, we can conclude that the deviation of S1101 in the L-σ relation in our previous study can be explained by low member statistics and galaxy interlopers, which are known to introduce biases in the estimated velocity dispersion.

Asteroseismology is a powerful tool to access the internal structure of stars. Apart from the important impact of theoretical developments, progress in this field has been commonly associated with the analysis of time-resolved observations.

The term macroturbulent broadening is commonly used to refer to a certain type of non-rotational broadening affecting the spectral line profiles of O- and B-type stars. It has been proposed to be a spectroscopic signature of the presence of stellar oscillations; however, we still lack a definitive confirmation of this hypothesis. <BR /> Aims: We aim to provide new empirical clues about macroturbulent spectral line broadening in O- and B-type stars to evaluate its physical origin. <BR /> Methods: We used high-resolution spectra of 430 stars with spectral types in the range O4 - B9 (all luminosity classes) compiled in the framework of the IACOB project. We characterized the line broadening of adequate diagnostic metal lines using a combined Fourier transform and goodness-of-fit technique. We performed a quantitative spectroscopic analysis of the whole sample using automatic tools coupled with a huge grid of fastwind models to determine their effective temperatures and gravities. We also incorporated quantitative information about line asymmetries into our observational description of the characteristics of the line profiles, and performed a comparison of the shape and type of line-profile variability found in a small sample of O stars and B supergiants with still undefined pulsational properties and B main-sequence stars with variable line profiles owing to a well-identified type of stellar oscillations or to the presence of spots in the stellar surface. <BR /> Results: We present a homogeneous and statistically significant overview of the (single snapshot) line-broadening properties of stars in the whole O and B star domain. We find empirical evidence of the existence of various types of non-rotational broadening agents acting in the realm of massive stars. Even though all these additional sources of line-broadening could be quoted and quantified as a macroturbulent broadening from a practical point of view, their physical origin can be different. Contrarily to the early- to late-B dwarfs and giants, which present a mixture of cases in terms of line-profile shape and variability, the whole O-type and B supergiant domain (or, roughly speaking, stars with M<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ≳ 15 M<SUB>☉</SUB>) is fully dominated by stars with a remarkable non-rotational broadening component and very similar profiles (including type of variability).

We propose the darkening caused by pores in areas of high magnetic field strength as a possible mechanism preventing this flux-clumping. We find that inflows decrease the amplitude of the axial dipole moment by 30%, relative to a no-inflows scenario. Stronger (weaker) inflows lead to larger (smaller) reductions of the axial dipole moment. The relative amplitude of the generated axial dipole is about 9% larger after very weak cycles than after very strong cycles.

We present second-epoch SPHERE-ZIMPOL observations of W Hya at minimum light (phase 0.54) as well as high-spectral resolution long-baseline interferometric observations with the AMBER instrument at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). <BR /> Methods: We observed W Hya with VLT/SPHERE-ZIMPOL at three wavelengths in the continuum (645, 748, and 820 nm), in the Hα line at 656.3 nm, and in the TiO band at 717 nm. The VLTI/AMBER observations were carried out in the wavelength region of the CO first overtone lines near 2.3 μm with a spectral resolution of 12 000. <BR /> Results: The high-spatial resolution polarimetric images obtained with SPHERE-ZIMPOL have allowed us to detect clear time variations in the clumpy dust clouds as close as 34-50 mas (1.4-2.0 R<SUB>⋆</SUB>) to the star. We detected the formation of a new dust cloud as well as the disappearance of one of the dust clouds detected at the first epoch. The Hα and TiO emission extends to 150 mas ( 6 R<SUB>⋆</SUB>), and the Hα images obtained at two epochs reveal time variations. The degree of linear polarization measured at minimum light, which ranges from 13 to 18%, is higher than that observed at pre-maximum light. The power-law-type limb-darkened disk fit to the AMBER data in the continuum results in a limb-darkened disk diameter of 49.1 ± 1.5 mas and a limb-darkening parameter of 1.16 ± 0.49, indicating that the atmosphere is more extended with weaker limb-darkening compared to pre-maximum light. Our Monte Carlo radiative transfer modeling shows that the second-epoch SPHERE-ZIMPOL data can be explained by a shell of 0.1 μm grains of Al<SUB>2</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB>, Mg<SUB>2</SUB>SiO<SUB>4</SUB>, and MgSiO<SUB>3</SUB> with a 550 nm optical depth of 0.6 ± 0.2 and an inner and outer radii of 1.3 R<SUB>⋆</SUB> and 10 ± 2R<SUB>⋆</SUB>, respectively. Our modeling suggests the predominance of small (0.1 μm) grains at minimum light, in marked contrast to the predominance of large (0.5 μm) grains at pre-maximum light. <BR /> Conclusions: The variability phase dependence of the characteristic grain size implies that small grains might just have started to form at minimum light in the wake of a shock, while the pre-maximum light phase might have corresponded to the phase of efficient grain growth.

We analyse the main impact of consistent accretion history on the evolution and lithium depletion of young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. These consistent models confirm the generation of a luminosity spread in Herzsprung-Russell diagrams at ages 1-10 Myr. They also confirm that early accretion can produce objects with abnormal Li depletion, as found in a previous study that was based on arbitrary accretion rates. The results strengthen that objects with anomalously high level of Li depletion in young clusters should be extremely rare. We also find that early phases of burst accretion can produce coeval models of similar mass with a range of different Li surface abundances, and in particular with Li-excess compared to the predictions of non-accreting counterparts. This result is due to a subtle competition between the effect of burst accretion and its impact on the central stellar temperature, the growth of the stellar radiative core and the accretion of fresh Li from the accretion disk. Only consistent models could reveal such a subtle combination of effects. This new result could explain the recent, puzzling observations of Li-excess of fast rotators in the young cluster NGC 2264.

Using natural guide star adaptive optics assisted observations with the Gemini Near-Infrared Integral Field Spectrometer (NIFS) and the natural seeing Gemini Multi-Object Spectrographs-North (GMOS), we derived two-dimensional stellar kinematic maps of NGC 4414 covering the central 1.5 arcsec and 10 arcsec, respectively, at a NIFS spatial resolution of 0.13 arcsec. The kinematic maps reveal a regular rotation pattern and a central velocity dispersion dip down to around 105 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. We constructed dynamical models using two different methods: Jeans anisotropic dynamical modeling and axisymmetric Schwarzschild modeling. Both modeling methods give consistent results, but we cannot constrain the lower mass limit and only measure an upper limit for the black hole mass of M<SUB>BH</SUB> = 1.56 × 10<SUP>6</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB> (at 3σ level) which is at least 1σ below the recent M<SUB>BH</SUB>-σ<SUB>e</SUB> relations. Further tests with dark matter, mass-to-light ratio variation and different light models confirm that our results are not dominated by uncertainties. The derived upper limit mass is not only below the M<SUB>BH</SUB>-σ<SUB>e</SUB> relation, but is also five times lower than the lower limit black hole mass anticipated from the resolution limit of the sphere of influence.

The origin of brown dwarfs is still under debate. While some models predict a star-like formation scenario, others invoke a substellar mass embryo ejection, a stellar disk fragmentation, or the photo-evaporation of an external core due to the presence of massive stars. <BR /> Aims: The aim of our work is to characterize the youngest and lowest mass population of the dark cloud Barnard 30, a region within the Lambda Orionis star-forming region. In particular, we aim to identify proto-brown dwarfs and study the mechanism of their formation. <BR /> Methods: We obtained ALMA continuum observations at 880 μm of 30 sub-mm cores previously identified with APEX/LABOCA at 870 μm. We have complemented part of the ALMA data with sub-mm APEX/SABOCA observations at 350 μm, and with multi-wavelength ancillary observations from the optical to the far-infrared (e.g., Spitzer, CAHA/O2000, WISE, INT/WFC). <BR /> Results: We report the detection of five (out of 30) spatially unresolved sources with ALMA, with estimated masses between 0.9 and 67 M<SUB>Jup</SUB>. From these five sources, only two show gas emission. The analysis of multi-wavelength photometry from these two objects, namely B30-LB14 and B30-LB19, is consistent with one Class II- and one Class I low-mass stellar object, respectively. The gas emission is consistent with a rotating disk in the case of B30-LB14, and with an oblate rotating envelope with infall signatures in the case of LB19. The remaining three ALMA detections do not have infrared counterparts and can be classified as either deeply embedded objects or as starless cores if B30 members. In the former case, two of them (LB08 and LB31) show internal luminosity upper limits consistent with Very Low Luminosity objects, while we do not have enough information for LB10. In the starless core scenario, and taking into account the estimated masses from ALMA and the APEX/LABOCA cores, we estimate final masses for the central objects in the substellar domain, so they could be classified as pre-BD core candidates. According to the turbulent fragmentation scenario, the three ALMA pre-BD core candidates should be gravitationally stable based on APEX/LABOCA data. However, this result is not consistent with the presence of compact sources inside the cores, indicative of on-going collapse. As an alternative scenario we propose that these cores could be the result of on-going gravitational contraction. Indeed, we have verified that their estimated masses are consistent with the ones expected within an ALMA beam for a r<SUP>-2</SUP> density profile, which is typical for a collapsing core. <BR /> Conclusions: ALMA observations have allowed us to detect very low-mass compact sources within three APEX/LABOCA cores. Future observations will help us to unveil their true nature.","citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916575","page":["A17"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..17H","bibgroup":["NRAO","NRAO/Telescopes","ALMA","Spitzer"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Huélamo, N.","de Gregorio-Monsalvo, I.","Palau, A.","Barrado, D.","Bayo, A.","Ruiz, M.

The Spectroscopy Made Easy (SME) package has become a popular tool for analyzing stellar spectra, often in connection with large surveys or exoplanet research. SME has evolved significantly since it was first described in 1996, but many of the original caveats and potholes still haunt users. The main drivers for this paper are complexity of the modeling task, the large user community, and the massive effort that has gone into SME. <BR /> Aims: We do not intend to give a comprehensive introduction to stellar atmospheres, but will describe changes to key components of SME: the equation of state, opacities, and radiative transfer. We will describe the analysis and fitting procedure and investigate various error sources that affect inferred parameters. <BR /> Methods: We review the current status of SME, emphasizing new algorithms and methods.

Galaxy clusters undergo mergers that can generate extended radio sources called radio relics. Radio relics are the consequence of merger-induced shocks that propagate in the intra cluster medium (ICM). <BR /> Aims: In this paper we analyse the radio, optical and X-ray data from a candidate galaxy cluster that has been selected from the radio emission coming from a candidate radio relic detected in NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS). Our aim is to clarify the nature of this source and prove that under certain conditions radio emission from radio relics can be used to trace relatively low-mass galaxy clusters. <BR /> Methods: We observed the candidate galaxy cluster with the Giant Meterwave Radio Telescope (GMRT) at three different frequencies. These datasets have been analysed together with archival data from ROSAT in the X-ray and with archival data from the Gamma-Ray Burst Optical/Near-Infrared Detector (GROND) telescope in four different optical bands. <BR /> Results: We confirm the presence of a 1 Mpc long radio relic located in the outskirts of a previously unknown galaxy cluster. We confirm the presence of the galaxy cluster through dedicated optical observations and using archival X-ray data. Due to its proximity and similar redshift to a known Abell cluster, we named it Abell 3527-bis. The galaxy cluster is amongst the least massive clusters known to host a radio relic. <BR /> Conclusions: We showed that radio relics can be effectively used to trace a subset of relatively low-mass galaxy clusters that might have gone undetected in X-ray or Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys. This technique might be used in future deep, low-frequency surveys such as those carried on by the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), the Upgraded GMRT (uGMRT) and, ultimately, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA).","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916529","page":["A15"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..15D","bibgroup":["CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["de Gasperin, F.","Intema, H.

With the ever growing number of detected and confirmed exoplanets, the probability of finding a planet that looks like the Earth increases continuously. While it is clear that the presence of a planet in the habitable zone does not imply the planet is habitable, a systematic study of the evolution of the habitable zone is required to account for its dependence on stellar parameters. <BR /> Aims: In this article, we aim to provide the community with the dependence of the habitable zone upon the stellar mass, metallicity, rotation, and for various prescriptions of the limits of the habitable zone. <BR /> Methods: We use stellar evolution models computed with the code STAREVOL, which includes the most current physical mechanisms of internal transport of angular momentum and external wind braking, to study the evolution of the habitable zone and the continuously habitable zone limits. <BR /> Results: The stellar parameters mass and metallicity affect the habitable zone limits most dramatically. Conversely, for a given stellar mass and metallicity, stellar rotation has only a marginal effect on these limits and does not modify the width of the habitable zone. Moreover, and as expected in the main-sequence phase and for a given stellar mass and metallicity, the habitable zone limits remain almost constant, and this confirms the usual assumptions of a relative constancy of these limits during that phase. The evolution of the habitable zone limits is also correlated to the evolution of the stellar activity (through the Rossby number), which depends on the stellar mass considered. While the magnetic activity has negligible consequence in the case of more massive stars, these effects may have a strong impact on the habitability of a planet around M-dwarf stars. Thus, stellar activity cannot be neglected and may have a strong impact on the development of life during the early stage of the continuously habitable zone phase of low-mass stars. Using observed trends of stellar magnetic field strength, we also constrain the planetary magnetic field (at the zero order) required for a sufficient magnetospheric protection during the whole stellar evolution. <BR /> Conclusions: We explain for the first time the systematic dependence of planet habitability on stellar parameters along the full evolution of low- and intermediate-mass stars. These results can be used as physical inputs for a first order estimation of exoplanetary habitability.","read_count":63,"citation_count":2,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916562","page":["A14"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A..14G","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Gallet, F.","Charbonnel, C.","Amard, L.","Brun, S.","Palacios, A.","Mathis, S."],"aff":["Department of Astronomy, University of Geneva, Chemin des Maillettes 51, 1290, Versoix, Switzerland","Department of Astronomy, University of Geneva, Chemin des Maillettes 51, 1290, Versoix, Switzerland; IRAP, UMR 5277, CNRS and Université de Toulouse, 14 Av.

We estimated the properties of the system at four evolutionary stages: (1) at the zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS); (2) immediately before the supernova (SN) explosion of the primary; (3) immediately after the SN; and (4) at the moment when Roche-lobe overflow began. <BR /> Methods: We used a hybrid approach that combined detailed calculations of the stellar structure and binary evolution with approximate population synthesis models. This allowed us to estimate potential natal kicks and the evolution of the BH spin. We incorporated as model constraints the most up-to-date observational information throughout, which include the binary orbital properties, the companion star mass, effective temperature, surface gravity and radius, and the BH mass and spin. <BR /> Results: We find at 5% and 95% confidence, respectively, that LMC X-3 began as a ZAMS system with the mass of the primary star in the range M<SUB>1,ZAMS</SUB> = 22-31 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and a secondary star of M<SUB>2,ZAMS</SUB> = 5.0-8.3 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, in a wide (P<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ≳ 2.000 days) and eccentric (e<SUB>ZAMS</SUB> ≳ 0.18) orbit. Immediately before the SN, the primary had a mass of M<SUB>1,preSN</SUB> = 11.1-18.0 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, but the secondary star was largely unaffected. The orbital period decreased to 0.6-1.7 days and is still eccentric 0 ≤ e<SUB>preSN</SUB> ≤ 0.44. We find that a symmetric SN explosion with no or small natal kicks (a few tens of km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) imparted on the BH cannot be formally excluded, but large natal kicks in excess of ≳120 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> increase the estimated formation rate by an order of magnitude.

We aim to determine the causes of the variation in emission across the CND. <BR /> Methods: SiO(3-2) and HNCO(6-5) emission has been imaged in NGC 1068 with the Plateau de Bure Interferometer (PdBI). We perform an LTE and RADEX analysis to determine the column densities and physical characteristics of the gas emitting these two lines. We then use a chemical model to determine the origin of the emission. <BR /> Results: There is a strong SiO peak to the east of the AGN, with weak detections to the west. This distribution contrasts that of HNCO, which is detected more strongly to the west. The SiO emission peak in the east is similar to the peak of the molecular gas mass traced by CO. HNCO emission is offset from this peak by as much as 80 pc (≤slant1''). We compare velocity integrated line ratios in the east and west. We confirm that SiO emission strongly dominates in the east, while the reverse is true in the west. We use RADEX to analyse the possible gas conditions that could produce such emission. We find that, in both east and west, we cannot constrain a single temperature for the gas. We run a grid of chemical models of potential shock processes in the CND and find that SiO is significantly enhanced during a fast (60 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) shock but not during a slow (20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) shock, nor in a gas not subjected to shocks at all. We find the inverse for HNCO, whose abundance increases during slow shocks and in warm non-shocked gas. <BR /> Conclusions: High SiO and low HNCO indicated a fast shock, while high HNCO and low SiO indicates either a slow shock or warm, dense, non-shocked gas. The East Knot is therefore likely to contain gas that is heavily shocked. From chemical modelling, gas in the West Knot may be non-shocked, or maybe undergoing a much milder shock event. When taking into account RADEX results, the milder shock event is the more likely of the two scenarios.

Gaia is a space mission that is currently measuring the five astrometric parameters, as well as spectrophotometry of at least 1 billion stars to G = 20.7 mag with unprecedented precision. The sixth parameter in phase space (I.e., radial velocity) is also measured thanks to medium-resolution spectroscopy that is being obtained for the 150 million brightest stars. During the commissioning phase, two fields, one around each ecliptic pole, have been repeatedly observed to assess and to improve the overall satellite performances, as well as the associated reduction and analysis software. A ground-based photometric and spectroscopic survey was therefore initiated in 2007, and is still running to gather as much information as possible about the stars in these fields. This work is of particular interest to the validation of the radial velocity spectrometer outputs. <BR /> Aims: The paper presents the radial velocity measurements performed for the Southern targets in the 12-17 R magnitude range on high- to mid-resolution spectra obtained with the GIRAFFE and UVES spectrographs. <BR /> Methods: Comparison of the South Ecliptic Pole (SEP) GIRAFFE data to spectroscopic templates observed with the HERMES (Mercator in La Palma, Spain) spectrograph enabled a first coarse characterisation of the 747 SEP targets. Radial velocities were then obtained by comparing the results of three different methods. <BR /> Results: In this paper, we present an initial overview of the targets to be found in the 1 sq. deg SEP region that was observed repeatedly by Gaia ever since its commissioning. In our representative sample, we identified one galaxy, six LMC S-stars, nine candidate chromospherically active stars, and confirmed the status of 18 LMC Carbon stars. A careful study of the 3471 epoch radial velocity measurements led us to identify 145 RV constant stars with radial velocities varying by less than 1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Seventy-eight stars show significant RV scatter, while nine stars show a composite spectrum. As expected, the distribution of the RVs exhibits two main peaks that correspond to Galactic and LMC stars. By combining [Fe/H] and log g estimates, and RV determinations, we identified 203 members of the LMC, while 51 more stars are candidate members. <BR /> Conclusions: This is the first systematic spectroscopic characterisation of faint stars located in the SEP field. During the coming years, we plan to continue our survey and gather additional high- and mid-resolution data to better constrain our knowledge on key reference targets for Gaia.

V766 Cen exhibits Na I in emission arising from a shell of radius 1.5 R<SUB>Phot</SUB> and a photocenter displacement of about 0.1 R<SUB>Phot</SUB>. It shows strong extended molecular (CO) layers and a dusty circumstellar background component. The other three sources are found to have lower luminosities of about log L/L<SUB>☉</SUB> = 3.4-3.5, corresponding to 5-9 M<SUB>☉</SUB> evolutionary tracks. They cover effective temperatures of 3900 K to 5300 K and radii of 60-120 R<SUB>☉</SUB>. They do not show extended molecular layers as observed for higher luminosity RSGs of our sample. BM Sco shows an unusually strong contribution by an over-resolved circumstellar dust component. <BR /> Conclusions: V766 Cen is a red supergiant located close to the Hayashi limit instead of a yellow hypergiant already evolving back toward warmer effective temperatures as discussed in the literature. Our observations of the Na I line and the extended molecular layers suggest an optically thick pseudo-photosphere at about 1.5 R<SUB>Phot</SUB> at the onset of the wind. The stars σ Oph, BM Sco, and HD 206859 are more likely high-mass red giants instead of RSGs as implied by their luminosity class Ib. This leaves us with an unsampled locus in the HR diagram corresponding to luminosities log L/L<SUB>☉</SUB> 3.8-4.8 or masses 10-13 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, possibly corresponding to the mass region where stars explode as (type II-P) supernovae during the red supergiant stage. With V766 Cen, we now confirm that our previously found relation of increasing strength of extended molecular layers with increasing luminosities extends to double our previous luminosities and up to the Eddington limit. This might further point to steadily increasing radiative winds with increasing luminosity.

The distribution of satellite galaxies around the Milky Way and Andromeda and their correlation in phase space pose a major challenge to the standard ΛCDM model of structure formation. Other nearby groups of galaxies are now being scrutinized to test for the ubiquity of the phenomenon. <BR /> Aims: We conducted an extensive CCD imaging survey for faint, unresolved dwarf galaxies of very low surface brightness in the whole Centaurus group region, encompassing the Cen A and M 83 subgroups lying at a distance of roughly 4 and 5 Mpc, respectively. The aim is to significantly increase the sample of known Centaurus group members down to a fainter level of completeness, serving as a basis for future studies of the 3D structure of the group. <BR /> Methods: Following our previous survey of 60 square degrees covering the M 83 subgroup, we extended and completed our survey of the Centaurus group region by imaging another 500 square degrees area in the g and r bands with the wide-field Dark Energy Survey camera at the 4 m Blanco telescope at CTIO. The surface brightness limit reached for unresolved dwarf galaxies is μ<SUB>r</SUB> ≈ 29 mag arcsec<SUP>-2</SUP>. The faintest suspected Centaurus members found have m<SUB>r</SUB> ≈ 19.5 mag or M<SUB>r</SUB> ≈ -8.8 mag at the mean distance of the group. The images were enhanced using different filtering techniques. <BR /> Results: We found 41 new dwarf galaxy candidates, which together with the previously discovered 16 dwarf candidates in the M 83 subgroup amounts to almost a doubling of the number of known galaxies in the Centaurus complex, if the candidates are confirmed. We carried out surface photometry in g and r, and report the photometric parameters derived therefrom, for all new candidates as well as previously known members in the surveyed area. The photometric properties of the candidates, when compared to those of Local Group dwarfs and previously known Centaurus dwarfs, suggest membership in the Centaurus group. The sky distribution of the new objects is generally following a common envelope around the Cen A and M 83 subgroups. How the new dwarfs are connected to the intriguing double-planar feature recently reported must await distance information for the candidates.","read_count":58,"citation_count":9,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916536","page":["A7"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A...7M","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Müller, Oliver","Jerjen, Helmut","Binggeli, Bruno"],"aff":["Departement Physik, Universität Basel, Klingelbergstr. 82, 4056, Basel, Switzerland","Research School of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Australian National University, Canberra, ACT, 2611, Australia","Departement Physik, Universität Basel, Klingelbergstr. 82, 4056, Basel, Switzerland"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201628921"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["NED:1","SIMBAD:40"],"keyword":["galaxies: dwarf","galaxies: individual: Centaurus group","galaxies: photometry","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nO.M. and B.B. are grateful to the Swiss National Science Foundation for financial support.

Models of star formation in the early universe require a detailed understanding of accretion, fragmentation and radiative feedback in metal-free molecular clouds. Different simulations predict different initial mass functions of the first stars, ranging from predominantly low-mass (0.1-10 M<SUB>☉</SUB>), to massive (10-100 M<SUB>☉</SUB>), or even supermassive (100-1000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>). The mass distribution of the first stars should lead to unique chemical imprints on the low-mass second and later generation metal-poor stars still in existence. The chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708, which has the lowest abundances of Ca and Fe of any star known, indicates it was enriched by a single massive supernova. <BR /> Aims: The photospheres of metal-poor stars are relatively transparent in the UV, which may lead to large three-dimensional (3D) effects as well as departures from local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE), even for weak spectral lines. If 3D effects and departures from LTE (NLTE) are ignored or treated incorrectly, errors in the inferred abundances may significantly bias the inferred properties of the polluting supernovae. We redetermine the chemical composition of SMSS0313-6708by means of the most realistic methods available, and compare the results to predicted supernova yields. <BR /> Methods: A 3D hydrodynamical Staggermodel atmosphere and 3D NLTE radiative transfer were applied to obtain accurate abundances for Li, Na, Mg, Al, Ca and Fe. The model atoms employ realistic collisional rates, with no calibrated free parameters. <BR /> Results: We find significantly higher abundances in 3D NLTE than 1D LTE by 0.8 dex for Fe, and 0.5 dex for Mg, Al and Ca, while Li and Na are unaffected to within 0.03 dex. In particular, our upper limit for [Fe/H] is now a factor ten larger, at [Fe/H] < -6.53 (3σ), than previous estimates based on ⟨ 3D ⟩NLTE (I.e., using averaged 3D models). This higher estimate is due to a conservative upper limit estimation, updated NLTE data, and 3D-⟨ 3D ⟩NLTE differences, all of which lead to a higher abundance determination. <BR /> Conclusions: We find that supernova yields for models in a wide range of progenitor masses reproduce the revised chemical composition. In addition to massive progenitors of 20-60 M<SUB>☉</SUB> exploding with low energies (1-2 B, where 1 B = 10<SUP>51</SUP> erg), we also find good fits for progenitors of 10 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, with very low explosion energies (<1 B). We cannot reconcile the new abundances with supernovae or hypernovae with explosion energies above 2.5 B, nor with pair-instability supernovae.","citation_count":15,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916593","page":["A6"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A...6N","bibgroup":["ESO/Telescopes"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Nordlander, T.","Amarsi, A.

Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) in the early Universe are potential antecedents of the most massive galaxies we see in the present-day Universe. An important step towards quantifying this galactic evolutionary connection is to investigate the fundamental physical properties of SMGs, such as their stellar mass content (M<SUB>⋆</SUB>) and star formation rate (SFR). <BR /> Aims: We attempt to characterise the physical nature of a 1.1 mm selected, flux-limited, and interferometrically followed up sample of SMGs in the COSMOS field. <BR /> Methods: We used the latest release of the MAGPHYS code to fit the multiwavelength (UV to radio) spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 16 of the target SMGs, which lie at redshifts z ≃ 1.6-5.3. We also constructed the pure radio SEDs of our SMGs using three different radio bands (325 MHz, 1.4 GHz, and 3 GHz). Moreover, since two SMGs in our sample, AzTEC 1 and AzTEC 3, benefit from previous <SUP>12</SUP>C<SUP>16</SUP>O line observations, we studied their properties in more detail. <BR /> Results: The median and 16th-84th percentile ranges of M<SUB>⋆</SUB>, infrared (8-1000 μm) luminosity (L<SUB>IR</SUB>), SFR, dust temperature (T<SUB>dust</SUB>), and dust mass (M<SUB>dust</SUB>) were derived to be log (M<SUB>⋆</SUB>/M<SUB>☉</SUB>) = 10.96<SUP>+ 0.34</SUP><SUB>-0.19</SUB>, log (L<SUB>IR</SUB>/L<SUB>☉</SUB>) = 12.93<SUP>+ 0.09</SUP><SUB>-0.19</SUB>, SFR = 856<SUP>+ 191</SUP><SUB>-310</SUB>M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, T<SUB>dust</SUB> = 40.6<SUP>+ 7.5</SUP><SUB>-8.1</SUB> K, and log (M<SUB>dust</SUB>/M<SUB>☉</SUB>) = 9.17<SUP>+ 0.03</SUP><SUB>-0.33</SUB>, respectively. We found that 63% of our target SMGs lie above the galaxy main sequence by more than a factor of 3 and, hence, are starbursts. The 3 GHz radio sizes we have previously measured for the target SMGs were compared with the present M<SUB>⋆</SUB> estimates, and we found that the z> 3 SMGs are fairly consistent with the mass-size relationship of z 2 compact, quiescent galaxies (cQGs). The median radio spectral index is found to be α = -0.77<SUP>+ 0.28</SUP><SUB>-0.42</SUB>. The median IR-radio correlation parameter is found to be q = 2.27<SUP>+ 0.27</SUP><SUB>-0.13</SUB>, which is lower than was measured locally (median q = 2.64). The gas-to-dust mass ratio for AzTEC 1 is derived to be δ<SUB>gdr</SUB> = 90<SUP>+ 23</SUP><SUB>-19</SUB>, while that for AzTEC 3 is 33<SUP>+ 28</SUP><SUB>-18</SUB>. AzTEC 1 is found to have a sub-Eddington SFR surface density (by a factor of 2.6<SUP>+ 0.2</SUP><SUB>-0.1</SUB>), while AzTEC 3 appears to be an Eddington-limited starburster. The gas reservoir in these two high-z SMGs would be exhausted in only 86 and 19 Myr at the current SFR, respectively. <BR /> Conclusions: A comparison of the MAGPHYS-based properties of our SMGs with those of equally bright SMGs in the ECDFS field (the ALESS SMGs) that are 870 μm selected and followed up by ALMA, suggests that the two populations share fairly similar physical characteristics, including the q parameter. The somewhat higher L<SUB>dust</SUB> for our sources (factor of 1.9<SUP>+ 9.3</SUP><SUB>-1.6</SUB> on average) can originate in the longer selection wavelength of 1.1 mm. Although the derived median α is consistent with a canonical synchrotron spectral index, some of our SMGs exhibit spectral flattening or steepening, which can be attributed to different cosmic-ray energy gain and loss mechanisms. A hint of negative correlation is found between the 3 GHz size and the level of starburstiness and, hence, cosmic-ray electrons in more compact starbursts might be more susceptible to free-free absorption. Some of the derived low and high q values (compared to the local median) could be the result of a specific merger or post-starburst phase of galaxy evolution. Overall, our results, such as the M<SUB>⋆</SUB>-3 GHz radio size analysis and comparison with the stellar masses of z 2 cQGs in concert with the star formation properties of AzTEC 1 and 3, support the scenario where z> 3 SMGs evolve into the present day giant, gas-poor ellipticals.","citation_count":4,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916544","page":["A5"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A...5M","bibgroup":["NRAO/Telescopes","ALMA","Spitzer","ESO/Telescopes","NRAO","Leiden Observatory","HST","CFHT"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Miettinen, O.","Delvecchio, I.","Smolčić, V.","Novak, M.","Aravena, M.","Karim, A.","Murphy, E.

These SMGs already have well-defined multiwavelength counterparts and redshifts. We also analyse the environments of four COSMOS SMGs spectroscopically confirmed to lie at redshifts z<SUB>spec</SUB> > 4.5, and one at z<SUB>spec</SUB> = 2.49 resulting in a total SMG sample size of 28. We search for overdensities using the COSMOS photometric redshifts based on over 30 UV-NIR photometric measurements including the new UltraVISTA data release 2 and Spitzer/SPLASH data, and reaching an accuracy of σ<SUB>∆z/ (1 + z)</SUB> = 0.0067 (0.0155) at z < 3.5 (>3.5). To identify overdensities we apply the Voronoi tessellation analysis, and estimate the redshift-space overdensity estimator δ<SUB>g</SUB> as a function of distance from the SMG and/or overdensity centre. We test and validate our approach via simulations, X-ray detected groups or clusters, and spectroscopic verifications using VUDS and zCOSMOS catalogues which show that even with photometric redshifts in the COSMOS field we can efficiently retrieve overdensities out to z ≈ 5. Our results yield that 11 out of 23 (48%) JCMT/AzTEC 1.1 mm SMGs occupy overdense environments. Considering the entire JCMT/AzTEC 1.1 mm S/N ≥ 4 sample and taking the expected fraction of spurious detections into account, this means that 35-61% of the SMGs in the S/N-limited sample occupy overdense environments. We perform an X-ray stacking analysis in the 0.5-2 keV band using a 32″ aperture and our SMG positions, and find statistically significant detections. For our z < 2 subsample we find an average flux of (4.0 ± 0.8) × 10<SUP>-16</SUP> erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> and a corresponding total mass of M<SUB>200</SUB> = 2.8 × 10<SUP>13</SUP>M<SUB>☉</SUB>.

Our results suggest a higher occurrence of SMGs occupying overdense environments at z ≥ 3 than at z < 3. This may be understood if highly star-forming galaxies can only be formed in the highest peaks of the density field tracing the most massive dark matter haloes at early cosmic epochs, while at later times cosmic structure may have matured sufficiently that more modest overdensities correspond to sufficiently massive haloes to form SMGs.","citation_count":7,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916525","page":["A4"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A...4S","bibgroup":["XMM","CXC","ESO/Telescopes","Spitzer","CfA"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Smolčić, V.","Miettinen, O.","Tomičić, N.","Zamorani, G.","Finoguenov, A.","Lemaux, B.

Electron cyclotron resonant scattering features (CRSFs) are observed as absorption-like lines in the spectra of X-ray pulsars. A significant fraction of the computing time for Monte Carlo simulations of these quantum mechanical features is spent on the calculation of the mean free path for each individual photon before scattering, since it involves a complex numerical integration over the scattering cross section and the (thermal) velocity distribution of the scattering electrons. <BR /> Aims: We aim to numerically calculate interpolation tables which can be used in CRSF simulations to sample the mean free path of the scattering photon and the momentum of the scattering electron. The tables also contain all the information required for sampling the scattering electron's final spin. <BR /> Methods: The tables were calculated using an adaptive Simpson integration scheme. The energy and angle grids were refined until a prescribed accuracy is reached. The tables are used by our simulation code to produce artificial CRSF spectra. The electron momenta sampled during these simulations were analyzed and justified using theoretically determined boundaries. <BR /> Results: We present a complete set of tables suited for mean free path calculations of Monte Carlo simulations of the cyclotron scattering process for conditions expected in typical X-ray pulsar accretion columns (0.01 ≤ B/B<SUB>crit</SUB> ≤ 0.12, where B<SUB>crit</SUB> = 4.413 × 10<SUP>13</SUP> G, and 3 keV ≤ k<SUB>B</SUB>T ≤ 15 keV). The sampling of the tables is chosen such that the results have an estimated relative error of at most 1/15 for all points in the grid. The tables are available online (see link in footnote, page 1).

Clusters of galaxies are important for cosmology and astrophysics. They may be discovered through either the summed optical/IR radiation originating from their member galaxies or via X-ray emission originating from the hot intracluster medium. X-ray samples are not affected by projection effects but a redshift determination typically needs optical and infrared follow-up to then infer X-ray temperatures and luminosities. <BR /> Aims: We want to confirm serendipitously discovered X-ray emitting cluster candidates and measure their cosmological redshift through the analysis and exploration of multi-wavelength photometric catalogues. <BR /> Methods: We developed a tool, the Integrated Cluster Finder (ICF), to search for clusters by determining overdensities of potential member galaxies in optical and infrared catalogues. Based on a spectroscopic meta-catalogue we calibrated colour-redshift relations that combine optical (SDSS) and IR data (UKIDSS, WISE). The tool is used to quantify the overdensity of galaxies against the background via a modified redMaPPer technique and to quantify the confidence of a cluster detection. <BR /> Results: Cluster finding results are compared to reference catalogues found in the literature. The results agree to within 95-98%. The tool is used to confirm 488 out of 830 cluster candidates drawn from 3XMMe in the footprint of the SDSS and CFHT catalogues. <BR /> Conclusions: The ICF is a flexible and highly efficient tool to search for galaxy clusters in multiple catalogues and is freely available to the community. It may be used to identify the cluster content in future X-ray catalogues from XMM-Newton and eventually from eROSITA.","citation_count":1,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","PUB_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916578","page":["A2"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A...2M","bibgroup":["CFHT"],"pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Mints, Alexey","Schwope, Axel","Rosen, Simon","Pineau, François-Xavier","Carrera, Francisco"],"aff":["Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP), An der Sternwarte 16, 14482, Potsdam, Germany ; Max-Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Justus-von-Liebig-Weg 3, 37077, Göttingen, Germany","Leibniz-Institut für Astrophysik Potsdam (AIP), An der Sternwarte 16, 14482, Potsdam, Germany","The University of Leicester, University Road, Leicester, LE1 7RH, UK","Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg, 11 rue de l'Université, 67000, Strasbourg, France","Instituto de Fisica de Cantabria (CSIC-UC), Avda. de los Castros s/n, 39005, Santander, Spain"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"orcid_other":["0000-0002-8440-1455","-","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201527166"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["SIMBAD:2"],"keyword":["methods: data analysis","galaxies: clusters: general","X-rays: galaxies: clusters","Astrophysics - Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics - Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nThis work has made use of data/facilities from the ARCHES project (7th Framework of the European Union No. 313146). \nFrancisco Carrera acknowledges partial financial support by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness through grants AYA2012- 31447 and AYA2015-64346-C2-1.

It is generally accepted that, in classical T Tauri stars, the plasma from the circumstellar disc accretes onto the stellar surface with free-fall velocity and the impact generates a shock. The impact region is expected to contribute to emission in different spectral bands; many studies have confirmed that the X-rays arise from the post-shock plasma but, otherwise, there are no studies in the literature investigating the origin of the observed UV emission which is apparently correlated to accretion. <BR /> Aims: We investigated the effect of radiative heating of the infalling material by the post-shock plasma at the base of the accretion stream, with the aim to identify in which region a significant part of the UV emission originates. <BR /> Methods: We developed a one-dimensional hydrodynamic model describing the impact of an accretion stream onto the stellar surface; the model takes into account the gravity, the radiative cooling of an optically thin plasma, the thermal conduction, and the heating due to absorption of X-ray radiation. The latter term represents the heating of the infalling plasma due to the absorption of X-rays emitted from the post-shock region. <BR /> Results: We found that the radiative heating of the pre-shock plasma plays a non-negligible role in the accretion phenomenon. In particular, the dense and cold plasma of the pre-shock accretion column is gradually heated up to a few 10<SUP>5</SUP>K due to irradiation of X-rays arising from the shocked plasma at the impact region. This heating mechanism does not affect significantly the dynamics of the post-shock plasma. On the other hand, a region of radiatively heated gas (that we consider a precursor) forms in the unshocked accretion column and contributes significantly to UV emission. Our model naturally reproduces the luminosity of UV emission lines correlated to accretion and shows that most of the UV emission originates from the precursor.","read_count":26,"citation_count":5,"year":"2017","property":["DATA","ESOURCE","ARTICLE","REFEREED","EPRINT_OPENACCESS","OPENACCESS"],"id":"14916595","page":["A1"],"bibcode":"2017A&A...597A...1C","pubdate":"2017-01-00","author":["Costa, G.","Orlando, S.","Peres, G.","Argiroffi, C.","Bonito, R."],"aff":["Dipartimento di Fisica & Chimica Università di Palermo, Piazza del Parlamento 1, 90134, Palermo, Italy ; Astrophysics sector, SISSA - International School for Advanced Studies, via Bonomea 265, 34136, Trieste, Italy","INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo, Piazza del Parlamento 1, 90134, Palermo, Italy","Dipartimento di Fisica & Chimica Università di Palermo, Piazza del Parlamento 1, 90134, Palermo, Italy; INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo, Piazza del Parlamento 1, 90134, Palermo, Italy","Dipartimento di Fisica & Chimica Università di Palermo, Piazza del Parlamento 1, 90134, Palermo, Italy; INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo, Piazza del Parlamento 1, 90134, Palermo, Italy","Dipartimento di Fisica & Chimica Università di Palermo, Piazza del Parlamento 1, 90134, Palermo, Italy; INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Palermo, Piazza del Parlamento 1, 90134, Palermo, Italy"],"orcid_pub":["-","-","-","-","-"],"orcid_other":["-","0000-0003-2836-540X","-","-","-"],"volume":"597","doi":["10.1051/0004-6361/201628554"],"pub":"Astronomy and Astrophysics","data":["SIMBAD:3"],"keyword":["stars: pre-main sequence","accretion","accretion disks","hydrodynamics","shock waves","X-rays: stars","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"database":["astronomy"],"ack":"\nPLUTO is developed at the Turin Astronomical Observatory in collaboration with the Department of Physics of Turin University.
